## GitHub Repository (10 points)

### Main Branch

IMPORTANT: ***All code in the main branch is production-ready.***

- New requirement, but I think we've mostly got this down.

The main branch should include:

- README.md :white_check_mark:

- ***All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis***
  - New item, but I think this technically already satisfied.
- ***Some code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project***
  - New item, but I think this technically already satisfied.

### README.md

The README.md ***must*** (used to be should) include:

- Description of the communication protocols :white_check_mark:
  - Team members communicate primarily via slack
  - Questions and comments are also relayed by leveraging the Google Apps' comments tool
  - Deliverables and issues are tracked in the team's google sheeet to ensure all team members are aligned on the status of all the project's component parts
  - All project files are available to team members via this Github repo

- ***Outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest)***
  - this is another new requirement, which I think we might already satisfying.
  - 2 Questions for Derek/Carlos:
    - Can our README serve as the outline?
    - Does our current segment 1 README meet expectations for this outline deliverable.

Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

### Individual Branches

Requirements for the individual branches follow:

- At least one branch for each team member :white_check_mark:
  - ***Double check we are free to delete member named branches.***

- Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the second segment (eight total commits per person)
  - ***Need to ask Derek/Carlos if these commits must be "contributing commits" or if branch commits also count***

List of all branches: ***will update after class/when we have feedback on some of the above***

- main
- james-branch
- alexa-branch
- livia-branch
- anthony-branch
- markdowns
- resources-branch
- database
- ml-model

Note: indvidual branches will soon be deleted in favor of role/deliverable aligned branches.

## Machine Learning Model (35 points)

IMPORTANT: ***THIS SECTION IS ALL NEW***

Team members submit the code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:

- Description of preliminary data preprocessing:

- Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision- making process:

- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets:

- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits:

## Database Integration (25 points)

IMPORTANT: ***THIS SECTION IS ALL NEW***

Team members present a fully integrated database:

- Database stores static data for use during the project
  - insert screenshot(s) when complete

- Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)
  - insert screenshot(s) when complete

- Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
  - insert screenshot(s) when complete

- Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
  - insert screenshot(s) when complete

General note: If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

Team note: ***We will have to update the technologies-used.md accordingly***

## Dashboard (0 points)

IMPORTANT: ***THIS SECTION IS ALL NEW***

A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:

- Storyboard on Google Slide(s)
