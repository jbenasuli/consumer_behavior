# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Google Colab will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis.

## Database Storage

Amazon S3 is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Colab to clean the data.

## Machine Learning

Spark is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Spark comes with a library named MLlib to perform Machine Learning tasks using the Spark framework. Since there is a Python API for PySpark, we can also use this Spark ML library in PySpark. MLlib contains many algorithms and Machine Learning utilities.
