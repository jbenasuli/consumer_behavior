We bought this because we were making a long distance move and knew our furniture would arrive a few days after we actually took possession of our new home. Unfortunately our furniture did not arrive until eight days (nights...) after closing so my wife and I had many more nights on this product than we had anticipated. Assembly was simple.  The directions were easy to understand, inflation took only a few minutes. It has been a very long time since we slept on air mattresses.  The &#34;old&#34; style made you feel like you were mere inches off the floor.  We did not have that feeling since the height of the mattress is 22 inches off the ground).  A most definite PLUS. The directions clearly state that new mattresses tend to lose air the first day or two and need an inflation &#34;touch up.&#34;  This happened but the touch up was very quick.  No complaints about that whatsoever. Overall comfort was good.  But it would be unfair to compare the comfort level to a &#34;real&#34; mattress.  Eight nights on it was a bit much for us so I would NOT recommend this for long term sleeping if you are &#34;retirement age.&#34;  Having written that, we will have NO hesitation whatsoever using this mattress when all our newfound northern friends decide to visit us in Florida...;&#62;) If this description sort of meets your needs/use, you will not regret buying this item.",8/4/2015

Just last week it didnt feel as firm as i wanted so i added a bit of air to it. And all i did was press the on button for 40 seconds to add the air, and do you know what happened . I woke up the next morning and LEFT side of the bed had mountained up so damn high, I was disgusted, , It look like a volcano about to pop. I completely got the deflated bed and decided to repump from start to see if i can get rid of that huge mount on the left side of the bed,  and it did not. It still remained there. So i said ok, let me continue sleeping on it for just another week or so and see, at 3 am, as iwas sleeping I hear this sound, kinda like the sound of a ballon being blown up or expanding, i woke up and this bed was expanding into a hill and mounting higher kinda like it was about to blow up. i quickly jumped out of bed and  turned the deflate knob to let the air out and deflate completely.  i bought this garbage. I wanted to even take photographs of the huge mount of the left side of the bed, but now that i have deflatted it - there will be no need - but if you want to see images of what i mean go search reviews online - many folks had the same issue as me - apparently it is termed as &#34;broken seams&#34;. Eventually you all might experience what i experienced.  If this thing had blown up on me I swear i woulda sued the company. RIght now all I am going to do is return it and get my money.

It's a nice solid bed, the people at intex do know what they're doing when it comes to their pop-up pools so the same quality material in an air mattress was appealing to me.<br /><br />It's a heavy bed, it's 22 pounds when it's not setup and bulky enough to take up a decent amount of room in my linen closet when it's not in use.  That being said though, it's also a nice sized bed compared to the standard air mattress that's just throw on the floor.<br /><br />You really need to allow this bed to pump up fully before having someone sleep in it.  I didn't realize that initially and then when my father got into the bed he sunk down into the middle because there just wasn't enough air in it. It appeared firm after about 3-5 minutes of a fill up time, but needed another minute or so to really give the stability someone needs to easily get in and out of the bed.<br /><br />The only complaint (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5) is the fact that if you are using this as a guest bed or a bed to travel with in general, you need to purchase a thin mattress topper for it. Even fully inflated it's a little uncomfortable to sleep on with how the grooves are laid out. Having that little bit of padding to counteract the 'valley's' makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />Price wise it's actually pretty good for the value. I was looking at a similar bed in a big-box for twice the price and it didn't even include the pump.  This one has the pump built into it, the dial is easy to open and close so you can decrease the firmness without having to get out of the bed, and the on/off switch for the fill-up is right next to the dial making it easy to re-inflate.  It holds the air pretty well, it was used solidly for two weeks and didn't need to be reinflated at all.<br /><br />I've seen other reviews where someone used this as their actual bed for a few years and it held up well - I can 100% believe that to be possible based on how well made the bed is as a whole.can 100% believe that to be possible based on how well made the bed is as a whole.",7/12/2015

After reading the reviews on this one I skeptically gave it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. I couldn't be happier! This thing is great, and SO reasonably priced! It's super comfortable, doesn't have any leaks (I've been using it for frequent guests for a year now), it's very tall so you don't have to get down on the floor, and the best part of all is the built in pump! While there is definitely a use for standalone, battery operated pumps, my situation doesn't call for it. I love that it plugs in so I'm not searching for C or D batteries (who keeps those on hand??) in the middle of the night when a friend decides to stay over. And even if I did have batteries on hand, the plug in pump is much faster and more powerful and never runs out of juice! Now the fact that it's built into the bed so I'll never lose it or grab the wrong pump for the wrong bed... fantastic! So convenient! It inflates and deflates very quickly. It folds up relatively compactly and comes with a convenient carrying bag. It stays inflated for as long as it's up. If it does settle a bit and need more air, you just hit the button on the side for a little boost. It is extremely comfortable. Many guests have asked where I got it so that they could purchase one for themselves. We have also used it several times for my teenage kids' sleepover guests, and my kids always opt to sleep on this bed with their friends rather than on their actual mattresses because they claim it's more comfortable. I am very happy with this airbed and would definitely recommend it.",7/10/2015

It inflated quickly and easily just like my twin always had, but the similarity ended there. After setting my tent up in a rock free area and inflating my new airbed I noticed that within hours the bed seemed to have lost air. I didn't think much of it, knowing that sometimes that first inflation requires some topping off, but midway through that first night of camping I realized the bed was losing a lot of air.  I still wasn't sleeping on the ground, but it was close. Still, I knew that being outdoors the air temps could have caused the problem, so I hoped another topping off would keep me off the ground for a whole night of sleeping. No such luck, even topping it off just before going to sleep by 3 am I was again sleeping on a deflated bed. It's become obvious that there is a slow leak somewhere, probably an improperly sealed seam.

Concerned about the quality over time.,"We bought this airbed at a great price! When it arrived in the mail, we opened it up and inflated it to make sure there weren't any holes. Fill-up is relatively fast. We left it inflated, with nobody sleeping on it, for about 6 days and it stayed full the whole time. When we took it camping the first time a few weeks later, the air didn't stay in so well. It was filled up on a Thursday afternoon, nobody slept on it until Friday night and it needed to have more air added before it was comfortable to sleep on. My boyfriend assures me it's because the air and material expand and retract with the hot tent during the day and cold desert air at night. However, I slept on it last night and it definitely lost air throughout the night, in a controlled temperature indoors. I'm not sure if there's a hole, but I will update this review if we find anything wrong with it.  Also, the bag that comes with it isn't very durable. The first time we rolled up the mattress and tried to slip it into the bag, it ripped a huge hole down the entire length of the bag. Sewed it shut and it seems to be doing okay now. If it rips again, we will use a more durable bag from an old sleeping bag.",4/17/2015

Not advisable for long term use.,"I bought this bed for around $40.00 in December last year and used it daily.  It's decently comfortable but does need to be topped off every few days the first few weeks you use it.  As the manufacturer says, the vinyl will tend to sag / expand a little.  After about two months of daily use, I started noticing a slight sagging around the midsection that wouldn't go away anymore.  I guess if you plan on using a bed long-term, you can expect some vinyl to expand.  That didn't bother me at all.  What really got me was when, one night, for no apparent reason, one of the mattress ridges like you see on the image burst and separated from the seam, leaving a large bulge on one side of the entire mattress.  Besides the discomfort of having to deal with a bulging air bed every night, the bed didn't lose air.

I have a good sized one bedroom apartment. I have me niece and nephew about every other month, I do a New Year's Eve celebration every year and I host misc. events and people spend the night. I went 3 years with out an airbed. People either hop in the bed with me, use the couch, or get on the floor. I anted to invest in a good bed and around Christmas this offered at an excellent price, Most ratings were great and it was listed as a best seller - not to mention there was a countdown and I only had about another hour to get it at that price so I took a chance. I love this bed. First I love that there is a compartment for holding the chord and it comes with it's own travel bag (which is great since everyone wants me to bring this with me now!). When I first used it for a friend who stayed the night on her birthday we watched it rise and rise and rise. it's pretty tall for an airbed. I guess I've really only seen the smaller ones and hadn;'t seen an airbed get so tall. We put some sheets and blankets on it and it was like heaven! It's my apartment, so mind you I have my own bed, I did not want to get off of this thing. That friend told everyone about this airbed and I'm convinced she only spends the night with me now just so she can sleep on this bed. And let me dare try to go over her house without bringing it with me. Anyhow, it's a really good bed. I'm not sure if this is an isolated experience, but I have nothing but good things to say about it. I've had it for about 3 months now.",3/12/2015

I tried just ignoring it but when I slept on the sides of the hump, the bed tilted and fell over or caved in. I'm not sure exactly what quite happened to the bed. It must just be cheaply made. I called Intex and after listening to the world's longest phone menu, I was in touch with someone who had such broken English that I could barely understand her. After repeating myself a dozen times to her, she informed me that the company was not going to take responsibility for the bed I purchased. They did not want to be held accountable.

ALL LEAKED WITHIN ONE MONTH. It is comfortable with an added top pad, but all 3 developed fast leaks within a month's use. I never could find where they leak, I suspected within the built in pump valve. Another down side, the AC pump is so noisy it disturbed my neighbors when I had to pump it up every few minutes during the night. The pump was fast, but sounded like a jet engine running. Noise was worse if you tried to use it while in the bed in the middle of the night after being trapped and wrapped up like a burrito unable to move. If you buy this thing, make sure your head is near the switch or you can't escape until all the air has leaked out. Assuming it doesn't smother you to death during the night. I thought this would be okay until I got to the 3rd one with the same issues of poor quality and leaking. Most leaked out half the air within 30 minutes, the worst being every ten minutes. They seem to last no more than one month before leaking. There is no way to repair the leak or even find it when this bed fails. Tears and holes I can fix, but bad pump designs that leak, nothing could be done except return them for a refund. You will see many used here due to this defect being resold.

I know these types of beds,"I got this bed right before christmas as a temporary bed to sleep on for a couple months. I was sleeping on a broken down twin size bed that was killing my back and causing great discomfort. I know these types of beds are not meant for continues use, however I have had many in the past that have lasted me quite some time with no problem when I have been in similar situations from moving. So I was excited to get this bed.<br /><br />The Good: It is of good height about the same as a regular bed from the floor. I am not struggling to roll out of the bed like a worm to only have to lift my self up off the floor from my knees. It is Perfect height for myself and my kiddo. It took only about 3 mins to inflate with the electronic component and stay inflated with out any issue for a few nights. I then deflated for a couple days when I slept on the couch and re inflated as I have done with other mattress to help the stretch. Again, it inflated right back up. It has been durable with a medium sized child jumping onto it to lay down, and with the dog jumping up on it. It was very comfortable to sleep on in comparison to my broken down twin bed for a few weeks. It didn't have leaks in any seems and stayed nice and firm for the majority of the first 3-4 weeks, with only minimal re-inflation (like 20 sec). Plus it fits my sheets snug.<br /><br />The Bad ( THE BEVELED BULGE): What makes me break down the stars on this bed is after the 4th or so week the top part seem (long seems on the flock top) popped, so it was no longer flat with the rest of the bed, but beveled up like a huge bubble. This made it somewhat uncomfortable, and there was no way to fix the seem as its glued together from the inside of the mattress. I was able to reposition my bed so it somewhat became a pillow for a week or so. I then deflated the mattress again to give it a rest for a couple days, while I was trying to troubleshoot any MacGyver fixes for this comfy piece of plastic to further sleep on. What I tried to do was put a bunch of blankets on the bed to level it up, but that didnt work. So I just sleept on it as it was, then in the middle of the night while sleeping, the second seem popped up making the beveled up bulge 2x as big not almost half the size of the bed. Which made it even harder to sleep on. I tried to examine it to see if I can make the others pop up to make it even, with no luck. So Now I have half the bed taller the other, and when I sleep I almost always end up int he middle with mild comfort. The last week has been VERY uncomfortable in this bed causing back and neck pain, So I will be purchasing a new bed sooner then hoped .",1/20/2015

I don't expect them to last forever; on average they last 18 months or so. I'm happy though, as the cost per month is very reasonable. The trick is to NOT over-inflate them; their downfall is always a ruptured inner segment that results in a mis-shapen mattress. I've never had a leak over the past seven years. So, for the money, while this mattress is not a &#34;Five&#34; it is definitely a &#34;Four&#34; as far as I am concerned, and I'll continue to buy one whenever the need arises. *UPDATE* I'm downgrading my 4 star to 1 star. The quality seems to be going downhill; A bed I started using in June 2015 just made it to the end of the year when a chamber gave way and a giant bulge erupted. I pumped up another bed on December 30, 2015 and this one only lasted until March 24, 2016. I had bought an Insta-Bed just after New Years fearing another lemon from Intex; lucky thing I did because I had to break it out and start using it March 25 2016. I'm hoping to get back to 18 months per bed with the InstaBed. I do like the taller beds, both the Intex and InstaBed are 22 inches tall so it's like getting out of a regular bed.

The built-in pump inflates really well, and I've had no complaints from my guests who've stayed on it.<br /><br />The problem is with deflation. There is no quick release to allow you to squeeze out the air. You have to turn the valve and then turn on the pump to allow air to be sucked out. The first 90% of air leaves without a hitch. However, as the last bits of air remain, the pump intake sucks in the mattress material and entirely blocks the flow. I have to repeatedly turn off the pump, try to pry the material away from the intake, hold the material, and then turn on the pump. Each time I do this I'm lucky if I can get 2-5 additional seconds of air being released before the material gets pulled into the pump again. Leaving the pump on would simply cause it to overheat and not expel any air. It can take me upwards of 20 minutes of this tedious and annoying process to get enough of the air out to a point where I can finally fold up the mattress without there being a huge bubble of air preventing me from stowing this away easily. Even after this process I can tell that all of the air is not out.<br /><br />This design is horrible as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, air mattress warranties and return policies are severely limited, so I'm trying to sell mine to someone who can put up with this problem so that I can have an air mattress that can fulfill it's required need of being convenient. I'll only consider buying another built-in pump design if there is a quick release option....otherwise I'm in the market for a mattress with an exterior/separate pump.<br /><br />I'm receptive to working with customer service trying to remedy this issue or explain the problem, but I've received no email response to my online complaint, and I won't wait again for over 30 minutes on hold to not be connected to an actual person in their customer service dept.",10/7/2014

At first it was fine. Comfy. An indent started to form in the middle of the bed after a couple of weeks. This made it hard to sleep because I always rolled into the middle of the bed. Impossible for two people to sleep on it at this point. We would roll into the middle and be almost on top of each other. Then it lost it's shape after about a month. I noticed the sheets did not fit anymore. All the sides blew out and the middle became a sink hole of sorts. It kept stretching and stretching outwards and around the base. At this point it is oval shaped kind of with a sink hole in the middle.. like a pond or pool, but with a rounded bottom. I was using it as a mattress on top of my box spring after my mattress starting giving me bad back pain. When it became oval, it would not stay on the box spring anymore. The bottom was not flat and it would tip easily. Then it started leaking, probably due to the stretching. It might be good for camping or for guests, but I don't suggest planning on using it as an every night mattress.    And just to add.. I was very careful with this bed. I wanted it to last. Most of the time, I was sleeping on it by myself. My boyfriend is in the Army and travels a lot. He was home for weekends. I weigh about 150 pounds. This should not have happened.",9/29/2014

It was ok at first...I liked the easy way it inflated and deflated. However, after about 4 months of not harsh use, the mattress began to explode on the inside!

Only one person has slept or laid on it at a time. No kids have ever been on it. Nobody has ever jumped on it or punctured it or done anything to this mattress but sleep on it. I don't even inflate it and deflate it all the time. It stays inflated all of the time. I have probably only completely deflated it twice. After a few months of use all of a sudden it just starts coming apart at the seems. I can hear it explode on the inside and then it starts to grow in weird ways. It has ballooned on the top and bottom of the mattress. It's a huge blob and is impossible to sleep on!<br /><br />I called the company and they said there is nothing they can do about their faulty mattress because I have had it for more than 90 days. Walmart will not replace it because it has been more than 90 days. I find this unacceptable because this mattress should last more than 4 months! This is a manufacturers defect and they need to stand by their products and have better customer service.<br /><br />On top of that when you call the corporate offices the receptionist will only transfer you to the customer service call center where it is outsourced to another country and they barely speak english and are difficult to understand.

Now 6 months later and after occasional use it is coming apart at the seams. 1st it developed a slow leak which may have been a puncture caused by me or the cat. Not sure since I have been unable to locate any hole on such a large surface. However, the pump has it back to proper firmness in no time. Now a major problem. The seams that form the pillows on top have begun tearing apart the entire length of the mattress leaving you with huge bulges. It is now unusable. For this reason I've dropped it to 2 stars.

I've used this bed as my primary bed and honestly it works great. The bed is very comfortable (I like a harder mattress) and the height is perfect. No one knew it was an airbed with the sheets on it.  My first one did have seams burst, but I know that this was because there was too much weight on it (family came in overnight) after that it went down hill. More seams burst until finally there was a slow annoying leak that I didn't bother to find so I just ordered another one.  This new one is just as good as the first one was so far and I would recommend it to others, just stay within the weight restrictions.",6/30/2014

So, we found the Intex Queen inflatable bed at a brick and mortar store locally and bought it there even though the price was higher than here at Amazon. We needed a bed and couldn't wait. As long as this mattress held air it was pretty comfortable, but that was only true for a short while after we brought it home from the store. For the first four or five weeks it worked fairly well, only requiring a top off once per day; however, for the last couple of weeks it has gotten progressively worse and now has to be filled before retiring, and every couple of hours during the night. I used a soapy water solution to check for leaks in the hope of finding something I could plug or patch but without success. I suspect that it is the air valve that leaks and think that Intex should include a plug for the round hole that allows air into and out of the mattress as an extra precaution against leakage. This is only a guess on my part, but the seams show no signs of leaking so what else can it be? I wanted to like this mattress and did at first. Now I have to buy another. It won't be an Intex this time.",6/29/2014

By the seventh night I am back on the couch.  I cannot find a leak, hear a leak, see a spot that could have a leak.  I have a feeling the bed is losing air from a faulty seam or the area around the pump, making it impossible to patch.  Please spend your money on a quality product with good customer service.

After the repair, the loss was slower, but stil was losing nearly half the air overnight. I finally bought a Sound Asleep Dream Series air mattress which I've been very happy with. I've used the Sound Asleep for a week now, & have just now had to top off with a very small amount of air to restore my desired firmness.

I would be couch surfing and staying places without a bed. I needed temporary bedding, and figured that I can use it for guests that stay over once I get into my own place.<br /><br />Overall this mattress has worked very well. The pump takes 3-5 minutes to fully inflate the mattress, and it can be set to inflate OR deflate which is super handy for set up and take down. It's a little difficult to get it back into the original bag it came in, and it can be difficult to get ALL of the air out when deflating it. But I guess that's a problem with all air mattresses to some extent.<br /><br />When sleeping on it it's pretty firm. Obviously this depends on how much you fill it, but overall it felt pretty stiff. I've been sleeping on it for about 3 weeks now, and definitely miss my softer bed back home. The top of the mattress is a nice suede / microfiber material, but I put a bed sheet over the top anyway, so that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />I dinged the review 1 star because I believe that this mattress leaks ever so slightly. The directions and website tell you that when you first get the mattress it will go through a period of &#34;stretching&#34; and you may have to continue to fill it a couple of times. But it's been 3 weeks and I have to top it off with air just about every day. It's not so bad that I can hear a leak, or feel it sinking.... but the fact that I can put in new air every day means that it's losing air somewhere. Maybe it's a byproduct of having the built in motor / pump.<br /><br />Would definitely buy it again just for the convenience of not having to use a foot pump. I love the electric pump feature. I have not had to use it without electricity, so I can't speak to inflating it WITHOUT the electric pump.",6/11/2014

It didn't leave a hole or anything but what it did is make for a huge ripple instead of the smaller ripples that I think make it so comfortable.  So now if I sleep on the right side of the mattress, I roll toward the center because it is like a huge bump.  I have been using this air mattress every night, while waiting for my furniture to arrive, for 5 weeks and have loved it.  I will continue to use it and just sleep on the other side because it is great other than the hump.  This may just be a fluke but you still need to know.  Also, the price for such a big air mattress is well worth it.  It comes with its own carrying bag an the electric inflate/deflate is super.  I love that the cord has its own compartment so it isn't just dangling getting stepped on or scratching the wall.  I have not contacted the manufacturer to find out if they will replace it.

In many ways it is.  It is very affordable.  It inflates quickly with the convenient internal pump. Full sized bed sheets fit it just fine.  Put a memory foam topper on it (approx $15-20) and it is very comfortable to sleep on without robbing you of your body heat.  So why the low rating?  Because, like many other reviewers, shortly after purchasing, the internal seams started tearing free, causing it to bubble up. I received mine at the end of January and started using it on Feb 1st.  at the beginning of April, the first internal seam let go.  I awoke in the morning to find a new bubbly bed companion.  Across the next month and a half, it has grown to take over half the bed.  The warranty is a tail light warranty.  When your tails lights can no longer be seen, your warranty is over.  Plus, they simply chalk the burst seams up to over inflation. which means they never have to cover anything under warranty because everything can be suspected of user error.  There is nothing to indicate when the bed is over-inflated, so you are just filling it to comfort level.  Having read the &#34;careful do not over inflate&#34; warning, I carefully monitored the filling process every time I added air, but to no avail.  When the seams started letting go, I looked up the warranty at the Intex site.  As I mentioned before, worthless.  It is clear that the reason the warranty is so short and so difficult to enforce is that the company expects there to be problems to begin with.  Any way, I gambled and lost, although the bed was comfortable for about 1-1/2 months. Feel free to take a spin at the roulette wheel.  You may be luckier than I was.  But, like gambling, you have to be willing to lose.",5/22/2014

The only reason I looked into a air bed was I needed a bed till I wanted to move my Cal King back into the room. Plus the cal king took up so much more room than this. And since the bed is for myself it was a good size. Just was hoping it would last a little longer since I am pretty light weight and am no where near the max weight it posted. But 6 months and now the seams on the side is bulging a bit. Afraid it might blow out on me if another month of usage. But I will be deflating it for my real bed soon.

I had family over the holiday and needed extra beds; I purchased the twin for my mom and a queen for my brother and his wife. The next morning everyone said they slept great. The twin version has a felt/cloth like material layer on top, this made it feel more like a bed and less like a plastic air mattress. They are pretty thick so you won't feel like you are sleeping on the floor; I want to say they are as tall as a standard coffee table. The next morning I found that 3 of my brother's kids and joined them on the bed (I say this to say it can even sustain midgets sleeping with you.)<br />Some have commented saying it loses air, but that comment seems to come from people trying to use it as a replacement bed; this is not what an air mattress is intended. Even if you do want to use it as a replacement bed, you would just have to add more air in it every few days.<br />When you first get it, be sure to read the instructions. My husband did (surprisingly) and you are instructed to fully inflate it and leave it inflated for a couple of hours before use. I love that it has a built-in electric pump. It takes about 3-7 minutes to fully inflate depending on how firm you want it to be. You have two options at deflating, letting the air escape out or using the pump in reverse. I recommend using the pump; it takes less than 5 minutes and over 95% of the air is out so you can fold it as compact as possible. It does come with a nice heavy duty cloth storage  bag.<br />The price is just icing on the cake.

I used it for less than 60 nights, total. At first, I liked its size, height and electric inflation system. No leaks or problems.<br /><br />Then, while sleeping in the middle of the night, I heard and felt what sounded like a gunshot. At first I didn't know what had happened and walked around the room looking for something heavy that might have plummeted to the ground. When I came back to bed, I saw that a third of the sleeping surface of the bed had risen 6&#34; above the rest of the bed. It was as if a single, six-foot bubble was bulging where another person would be sleeping. The bed didn't deflate, but it was now totally uneven on one side. My guess is that one of the internal air compartments of the bed burst and caused the section to lose its structure. I'm a lightweight person, so I shouldn't have been stressing the strength of the bed.<br /><br />Since most of the bed was still fine, I continued sleeping on it. My mistake! A few weeks later, I was awoken by another loud, cracking boom. Something inside the bed burst again, and the rise that had been 6&#34; was now 10&#34; tall. Very scary and alarming! Now the bed is totally unusable. It still didn't deflate, but it did become severely uneven.<br /><br />I contacted Intex via their customer service email system, but haven't heard back. Based on other people's reviews, I don't expect to ever hear anything.<br /><br />While this wasn't an expensive bed, I expected it to last through more than two months of use. The frightening way that it stopped working is enough to keep me from every trusting an Intex airbed again.",1/8/2014

Each night, it started to sag more, and he kept having to air it up. We returned it for a replacement. Well, we didn't have any occasion to use it throughout the year until the fall. My husband used it twice indoors, on carpet, to &#34;camp out&#34; inside with my youngest. He had to air it up mutliple times throughout the night both times. By then, though, Amazon's warranty had expired. I called the company about replacement, and they stated that none of their products come with a warranty of any kind when bought directly from them. They said the only warranty I could expect to get is from the place of purchase. That's ridiculous. Why would anyone ever buy directly from the company? A zero return, zero warranty policy?<br /><br />So, I called Amazon to explain the situation and see if there was anything they could do, knowing that it was well beyond the return window. They were fantastic. I didn't get a full refund or exchange, and didn't really expect to. I decided it wouldn't hurt to call and see if they could offer anything back though. I'm glad I did. The customer service lady that I dealt with was so kind. She kept having to check with her peer/supervisor to see what could be done. It was obvious that good customer service was her goal. She also kept coming back on the line to let me know she was still working on it. Ultimately, because Amazon is fantastic, and (I think) I'm an extremely loyal customer, buying almost everything on Amazon, they gave us a partial Amazon credit to try and rectify the situation as much as they could. I really didn't expect this, and they would have been well withing their policy to deny any kind of return. This kind of customer service is what keeps me coming back to Amazon again and again. I don't return items often, but when I do, Amazon always exceeds my expectations.<br /><br />The airbed would get 1 star if it weren't for the fact that it's comfortable. The comfort level raises it a bit to a 2.<br /><br />If it were all about Amazon's customer service, I'd give them a 10 out of 5! Thank you, Amazon.",12/29/2013

The flocked top helps it stay in place, and if you push the sheet aside in your sleep then the mattress surface is soft and not like laying on an inner tube.<br /><br />Because it's thick, it's larger than some airbeds when you store it.

I was replacing a really old matress that we lost the plug for. I have had several of these and this seems to be one of the better ones. You cannot lose the pump, plug, or cord as they are all self contained. You cannot remove the plug, it just turns to inflate, deflate, or close. The pump will pump it up, or defalte the unit and it all fits in it's own bag for easy storage. We have used it twice and even had kids jumping on it before we decided to deflate it. It held up with both of them jumping on it. Great lightning deal!<br /><br />6/25/16:<br />Still going strong. Every air matress leaks a bit of air because they are vinyl. Newer more expensive inits have secondary quite pumps that maintain constant pressure. Mine still gets you through the night no problem but will need some air the next day if two adults slept on it. I bought one of these for my mother as well for when the kids are there. It also has had no issues. My sister and hubby have slept on it many nights at the lake as well. I have definately gotten my money out of this one. I also own an ez-bed which is the higher end. While more comfortable to sleep on it is litterally 10x the price.

For less than the price of a seedy hotel room, you get a fairly comfortable nights sleep -certainly better than any futon I have slept on. My first one was bought after my daughter's $250 Aerobed went flat within a month...and I slept on that one for many many nights while visiting her over a period of two years. When I wasn't there she had guests and roommates use it. It is now the &#34;spare bed&#34; in our house, and my brother, who has joint damage and would not originally even consider an air mattress, sleeps so well on it he is considering getting one. My next one was a gift to my sister, who often has out of town guests she opens her sofabed for....my next two were for my son - one for him to sleep on until he gets a ral bed, and one for me to use while I visit. His apartment is so small I have to inflate it and deflate it every day, which I don't think is ideal for their longevity, but it works fine. A few tips - looks at how it is rolled up as it comes out of the box - it is NEVER going back in that box, but seeing how they got it so small will help when you deflate it. Roll it back up while the deflate motor is still running. You need at least one fairly thick layer between you and the mattress - I use an old comforter then put a sheet on - or the cold air in the mattress will chill you.",12/2/2013

Then suddenly in the middle of the night while we are sleeping a huge *pop* and the seam on the far side under me had broken and a huge hump pushed up under me, forcing me to roll towards the middle.

It was 75 dollars when we bought it- I see why it is 50% off now!

For one night, everyone camped all over my house, and the Airbed was used in the den for one couple who drew the short straw and didn't get the spare room. It's comfortable enough--this is one of the 2nd generation air beds--the first generation were flat on the floor without the raised \\""box spring\\"" and not so comfortable. I still find these a bit bouncy and squishy but they aren't as bad as a sleeper couch and they can be stored in a coat closet or garage between uses.<br /><br />One other application you might not consider; emergency bug-out bedding. During the last hurricane (Sandy!), the Red Cross announced that they'd run out of cots and people who were forced to evacuate were told to bring their own bedding. I have camping mats but it's not a comfortable night on a hard floor; I spent a month on one on a tile floor (long story...) and I'd wake up at 3:30am because I just plain couldn't stand it any more. You can pile this into the trunk of the car for emergencies and have your own place to sleep. The only issue is that it requires some kind of electricity to pump up (could be from a car battery adapter) but an emergency shelter may have power and let you plug it in.<br /><br />For \\""Glamping\\"", these are pretty nice as well. Some camping areas have electric service or you can get an adapter for your car battery, and you use this in a tent for a more luxurious night's sleep. At this price, the bed is a good standby, though I am not sure I'd use it as a bed replacement for a long stretch of time.",11/17/2013

I also purchased a 2\\"" foam topper at BedBath&Beyond, just to provide a bit more comfort. I've used it three times and all three people reported being happy with the comfort. Each time, I would fold it up and put it back in its bag. I just got it out for a fourth visitor and discovered that after it sits for a few hours (with no one using it), it has lost quite a bit of air. I have no idea where the leak might be. The bed has not been roughly used and I have carefully deflated and folded it up back up after each use. That's the whole point of an airbed. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. It's been six months so I'm not sure what my options are to get it replaced.<br /><br />----------<br />Update 11/3<br /><br />With the help of my friend, we were able to locate a small hole on the bottom of the bed and I was able to patch it. This appears to have solved the slow leak problem. It is a little puzzling how this hole happened. The previous guest reported no problems and after he left the bed was folded and returned to its storage bag. Then it was unfolded and inflated for the recent guest and a leak was immediately evident (before he had arrived and slept on it). If there had been something in the rug that poked into the mattress, I would have thought this would have happened with the previous guest and been evident then. It is hard to imagine something small poking a hole into the mattress this most recent time with only the weight of the inflated mattress (and it leaked immediately). That leaves me believing that it happened during the folding for the storage last time. There could have been something in the rug and it poked the hole when I pushed down on the mattress to fully deflate and fold. Or perhaps, it is was caused by the folding itself, i.e., at a fold corner. Jury is still out.<br /><br />I'm giving the mattress the benefit of the doubt for now, assuming it was something that poked into it - and raised the stars back to four. But I'm not yet convinced this is the case. I'll be much more careful folding this time and I've decided to use a \\""ground cloth\\"" under the bed to ward off things that might be hidden in the rug, similar to what I use to protect a tent floor.",10/29/2013

I've slept on a memory foam mattress for several years now and this bed matches that comfort level quite well. I've used air beds in the past & they tend to be a bit on the cold side due to there being nothing but air in them. The memory foam layer creates a barrier to address that issue.

It's hosted countless guests since then. We've slept on it (total weight about 360#, plus an occasional pet or niece) 2-5 nights a month, every month, when visiting in-laws. We've taken it camping a couple times. More than once, it's been forced to handle more than its 500# weight limit, which I think is what finally strained it until it started leaking. On the new one, I'll take that weight limit seriously. ;)<br /><br />It started losing air overnight this past summer, and needed reinflation during the night more than once this past visit, so I pulled out my extended warranty card to replace it--and discovered that the warranty ran out 7 months ago. I'm OK with that; it served its purpose.<br /><br />Tip: I love that plugging it in to deflate with power, and folding it neatly while the motor runs for a few seconds, allows me to fold it as flat and perfect as when we first opened the box. I've never had an air mattress that would do that.<br /><br />I'm buying another one today (the one above, since it looks like my model is discontinued).

I got this bed on August 5 and been using it every night when I'm home as my main bed.<br /><br />First off, the bed is as advertised. It has a built in pump, which not only inflates but speed up deflation of the bed. It takes about 4 minutes to do so. When I visit a family member a few weeks ago and use their airbed, they have a separate and extremely loud pump. This pump is so loud and shakes so violently, I actually feared that it would blow up every time I used it. A little girl cried each time the pump is on and must be taken to a separate room. So, with that being said, the pump isn't as loud (it's loud that you'll hear it with the door close, but not so loud that you'll hear it across the house).<br /><br />I almost always managed to get the airbed to the firmness I need. But as the temperature drops, I started to noticed that the mattress got more and more lumpy. I decided to read up on air beds and noticed that this is actually normal. I just have to top off the air supply and I should be fine. However, in my quest to keep the bed firm, I might have pumped a little too much air into the bed, causing one the rifts in the top to unfastened and now, it's a very noticeable air bubble.<br /><br />To visualize the air bubble, look at the picture of this airbed. Then imagine a small log going across it.<br /><br />The rip didn't cause the bed to rip apart, causing deflation. But now the bed looks funny. Does it messes up the sleeping experience? No. While it sorta looks comical, it did not hamper my sleeping/napping needs.<br /><br />Regardless of the now comical look of the bed, I'm going to give it a nice 5 stars. I don't have any issues with it. It didn't deflate, there's no holes in the bed, and it stands my sleeping on it for one month.",9/7/2013

This was, however, half the price of a comparable one at Target so there you go. Come on over grandma, no I don't have a guest bedroom we have 4 kids, but you can luxuriate on the finest foreign made inflatable bed a bargain hunting internet user could possibly offer. It really does inflate in just a couple minutes and storing it is easier than hiding a body. If you have a mattress pad or an extra quilt or two you will want to lay those down on top of the bed before putting on your favorite fitted sheets. Sleeping directly on the airbed without some insulation will suck the heat out of you, even in a warm room, and you will wake up cold and stiff. Unless you want to passive aggressively make someone miserable. To which I say... I get it. We all remember the Christmas you were the only one that didn't get a gift from grandma, and hey, nothing says family love like hanging onto a petty resentment for 10 years.<br />  So buy with the confidence that you can present yourself as a great value concerned host who can offer a nice firm tall easy to use bed at half of what Mark and Suzie paid for their piece of crap that didn't come with its own built in pump.

Tried it out before they arrived. A dial on the included electric pump allows you to dial inflate or deflate, using the pump to do all the hard work. If you loose electricity and have a 12volt, battery pump, or foot pump on hand, a hole in the inflate/deflate dial allows you to still inflate deflate, although I imagine the foot pump might take you a while to get this bed firm. Without using a stopwatch, I am estimating about 5 minutes to inflate and 5 minutes to deflate, using the built in electric pump. I found the firmness to be comfortable and supportive. When it is all blown up its double height allows you to climb into bed, not crawl off the floor, like the older style inflatables. For the price, I felt this was a great deal and even comes with a carry bag for easy storage. Just make sure you follow the folding directions, in the package, that show you how to fold the bed to get it into that bag.

We found that 3 holes already appreared in the top section of the mattress right at the lower inner seams of the bed.

Once again we checked the seams and found that 2 more holes appeared in the opposing upper inner seams of the mattress. after 5 months of using this mattress we have spent about $30 on rubber cement and patches and all of the upper inner seams have had holes in it. If you do decide to purchase this I recommend purchasing enough patches for 15 seams or so give or take a couple. better even to just go ahead and patch all the seams that are not rounded corners and be done with it. You will also experience bulging as weve come to call it. The mattress will separate from its inners and create an inner tube like appearance and eventually itll be a giant donut.

Of course by then the warranty was obsolete and Intex wanted nothing to do with addressing the issues. One of the seams kept coming apart. I attempted to patch, glue, tape, silicone, etc etc etc. Nothing worked! After about the 10th use and last time I chose to wake up on the ground I decided to drive to the local dump and get rid of this waste of money. In all the garbage of an air mattress cost me about $20 in repair stuff that didn't work, $6 in dump fee's. Not to mention numerous nights of waking up on the ground as this substandard joke of a bed held air about as well as a human holding their breath under water.

My guests said that it was about as comfortable as an air mattress could be and they even said that they wanted to buy one for their house.  I did notice that there was a bit of sagging, like a few other reviews had noted, in the middle of the mattress after them only sleeping on it for 2 nights.  Some reviewers had said that it wasn't a true queen sized mattress but I didn't find that to be the case.  Other than there not really being anywhere for the fitted sheet to wrap around, my queen sheets fit it just fine.  We did have to add a little more air for the second night but that's typically to be expected with an air mattress.  When it was time to deflate it, I really liked that the pump also deflated the mattress which saved lots of time and made it very easy to roll up.  All in all, it took about 5 minutes to get it deflated, rolled up and stored away in the bag.  Speaking of which, there were step by step instructions on how to roll it so it would fit in the bag.

I have advanced MS and since I would have to care for him, I could not go up and down the steps providing him with  food and such that he'd need, and so to make it easier on me, I opted to set up this bed [queen size] in our downstairs while he recovered. Even at its firmest, it proved to be too soft for my husband as he would have to put pressure on his chest in order to get out of it, but it was very comfortable otherwise. I personally used it off and on (instead of climbing stairs) in the middle of the day when I tired for two months before deflating and storing it. I used the original box since the canvas bag proved too difficult for me to use.<br /><br />In August 2012, I tore the calf muscle in my left leg and couldn't walk very far, let alone go up any steps, so I set up this bed again for me to use. I need the mattress to be very firm for me to get up from it so I would keep maximum air in the mattress. A month later, because of constantly adding air to achieve this firmness, it eventually stretched the vinyl chambers and caused the mattress to break down. As I lay one morning, I could hear the small popping sound of the vinyl letting go. Luckily, I realized what was happening and was able to inflate it enough from a lying position to allow myself to get out of it. I loved the comfort and ease of using the inflation/deflation [toggle] switch so much that I pondered buying the same bed again, but was afraid the same would occur so I decided to try a [queen] Wenzel Insta-bed instead.<br /><br />I talked with the Wenzel people when receiving the bed and I found that these beds should not be filled to be totally firm, otherwise it will cause the vinyl to break down. Knowing this, I have learned a way to get out of bed while it's softer. Wish I knew this back when I had the Intex because I found the Intex a little more comfortable and much easier to use when inflating/deflating. The Insta-bed has two dials that youturn to inflate the bed. It's very hard for a person with dexterity problems to use and almost impossible to inflate from a lying position in bed. Still, this bed has served me well for nearly 9 months but is starting to show signs that the vinyl is giving a bit. (I can no longer climb steps so I'm finding myself sleeping downstairs until other arrangements are made).<br /><br />I'm giving the Intex 4 stars (the Wenzel 3 stars because of the switch) for its comfort and ease of operation. I can only assume responsibility of causing the vinyl to break down so quickly from keeping it at the firmest level I could. If I bought this mattress again and found that the vinyl still broke when taking care of not keeping it at total firmness level, I would lower the score, but since I can only assume it broke down due to abusing the air capacity, I have to rate it high. If Intex found a way for this mattress to not be firmer when getting out of it, I would give it a 5 star rating.",5/22/2013

At 22 inches, it's so tall that my in-laws no longer find it difficult to get in and out of bed, unlike the previous two that we've had (19 & 17 inch).<br />2. The in-built pump is one of the best features of this one. Simply plug in to an outlet and switch it on - it's that simple. It nicely tucks back into the bed and we found this to be the best out of all the air-beds that we've owned.<br />3.

She loaned us hers as a temporary solution and since then we haven't looked back.  I ordered the one featured here, and I can enthusiastically say that it's a great buy for the money.  When fully inflated its height is comparable to a regular bed (double the height of the one my mother-in-law loaned us), making entry and exit for two 50-year-old adults very easy.  Because it's an air mattress we can inflate or deflate it to a level of firmness or softness that's best for us, similar to that of one of the more expensive 'numbers' mattresses.  Because of this I find it to be the most comfortable bed that I've slept on in a long time and we've decided to keep this one rather than buying a regular mattress.  The built-in pump makes both inflation and deflation a piece of cake.<br /><br />We've found only one negative:  For some reason, after a couple of weeks it began to lose air nightly, not fully deflating, but just enough to make the mattress much softer than we prefer.  This though is an easy fix by simply turning on the air pump for roughly 15 to 30 seconds and reinflating it.  We haven't been able to locate any leaks, so we're not sure why this is happening.

My body was seriously in a &#34;V&#34; position. We inflated it in the middle of the night and the same thing happened by the morning. I cannot imagine how their could be a hole since it was on carpet, and was put right back in the bag after we used it the firs time. The third time we used it, it was so bad that my husband slept on the floor instead. Wouldn't recommend.",4/16/2013

The height is comparable to a mattress + box spring + bed frame. It's comfortable to sleep on, doesn't have a strong odor, and is sturdy.<br />The bad news is that it's risky to deflate. I deflated mine prior to moving to a new apartment and the mattress didn't survive the deflating process, developing a fast leak that meant I was near the floor about halfway through the night. There is no quick release valve for deflating the mattress; you turn a valve and gently, aka slowly, apply pressure to the mattress to ensure that air flows out of it (this takes about 20 minutes). I ended up buying a new mattress since my mattress was about 40 days old when it died. Another $58 dollars spent.<br />I like the mattress but the deflating procedure makes this impractical for camping or periodic use. It's great as a cheap bed.",3/14/2013

I was debating between this unit and http://www.amazon.com/Wenzel-Insta-Bed-Raised-Bottom-Built-/dp/B000ETXX1U/ but I figured I'd give this a shot first since I had two week long guests visiting soon - worst case I'd swap them out.<br /><br />I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.  While it's not perfect, more on that in a second, it's amazingly comfortable - better than some real beds I've slept on.  The negatives are that it takes a long long time to inflate fully and it's a bit of a pain to deflate and get it back into it's bag.  I assume this is partially a function of the raised aspect but the motor seemed weak compared to the aerobed.  Overall though I'm very happy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+++ Comfortable<br />++ Cheap<br />+ Cord stores inside for easier storage<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Slow to inflate<br />- Difficult to deflate fully and store<br /><br />Again, while not perfect (4.5 stars if I could), given the comfort and the cost it's amazing.

When I book rooms for my trips, I book larger single bedrooms for a lower price, then bring my Intex bed along and instantly turn a single room into a 2 bed suite! This bed fully inflates and deflates in under 4 minutes. It's very comfortable and durable.  It can hold over 350 lbs. in weight. The built-in air pump is extra convenient.  It also comes with a carry bag. I highly recommend KEEPING your Intex bed in this bag at all times when not in use.  Keeping it in the bag has kept it like brand new the entire time that I've had it and my cat doesn't have a chance to claw at it or poke holes into it(like my last air bed before these).  Overall, a quality air mattress for a great price!<br /><br />Just a note: If you're buying an air mattress to go on trips to cold places or there is any type of draft in the bedroom you will be using this in, you may want to put a comforter on top of the mattress before going to sleep on it in addition to any other fitted sheet, blanket or comforter you will be using.

It was great the first month and a half I had it.But from then it went downhill. Small holes (that are not so easy to find, and I have tried using soap and looking for bubbles) are the culprit for the bed deflating in the middle of the night, a feat that requires waking up 3-4 times to reinflate. My boyfriend and I have woken up with our butts touching the floor, being taco-ed inside what's left of the air mattress.  I frequently find small holes and patch them up, but there are always more holes to cause deflation.<br /><br />Also, the chambers are now merging as well.

The price varies considerably so if you don't need it straight away, I'd put it in your cart, click save for later, and then buy it when the price drops again.<br /><br />I recently had to get a city apartment because of a transfer where I stay during the times that I'm working. I am home when I'm not. That means I had to furnish the city apartment with things from home without disturbing my family's comfort or needs. I decided to take a guest bed that we haven't been using for a while but that used to be my regular bed some years ago. The catch was, I wouldn't have things for the first week I was there before the mover's came. Enter my need for an airbed.<br /><br />I'm a huge Amazon shopper because of the reviews and this is the one I chose based on those reviews. There is always some risk when purchasing anything that has to hold air, of course, but I wasn't at all disappointed. Quite the reverse!<br /><br />This thing is tall! You can't really see if from the pictures but this mattress is about the height of a mattress and box springs put on the floor without a frame. It's also super easy to put up. Just plug it in and turn it on. Voila...two minutes later a fully inflated bed. I slept on it very, very comfortably during that first week while waiting for the movers. I felt just fine waking up and going to work with not a single sore spot. Slept like a baby.<br /><br />After my household goods arrived and I was all set up, I naturally moved onto the bed I brought in the master bedroom. Uhh...yeah...I've apparently changed (gotten a few crucial years older) since I last used that bed. I was miserable on the real bed. So much so that I moved back into the smaller bedroom with the air mattress! That's where I've been since. There's no question that I sigh with relief when I get home and use my regular bed on my trips home, but I'd have to say that this air mattress is a very close second in comfort.<br /><br />I was home for 3 weeks and left the air mattress up and when I returned to the city apartment, I figured it would be at least a little deflated. Nope. Still perfectly inflated! And I tried the regular bed again and was miserable again...so still on the air mattress. To fix the problem, I've ordered a gel and memory foam thick topper for the regular bed from here on Amazon and I'm sure I'll review and see if it makes it livable, but until then, I'm super happy with this mattress.is a very close second in comfort.<br /><br />I was home for 3 weeks and left the air mattress up and when I returned to the city apartment, I figured it would be at least a little deflated.

This bed is great!,"I have purchased products from Intex before and have one of their older model air beds which we use occasionally for unexpected guests and when our kids want to camp out in the living room (I do not use this type of bed for everyday and don't think it's meant for that type of use). Honestly, I'm tired of dragging the shopvac up from the basement every time I want to inflate the mattress so I decided to purchase the self-inflating bed.<br /><br />The item arrived very quickly (within two days), well packaged and in perfect condition. The bed inflated in about 3 minutes (amazing!). The bed height is wonderful, about the same height as a typical sofa so getting ot of it isn't uncomfortable like my old one was. Only drawback is it's tough to put fitted sheets on it (no separation of mattress for it to grip on) but you can just use two flat sheets. I added a mattress pad and it made all the difference in the world, much more comfortable and you don't hear the typical airbed noises when you move around. The self-deflate feature works great and makes it much easier to get the bed really flat (Intex provides instructions on folding the bed so it goes back in the provided carry bag - and it does go back in the bag!!). Overall, if you are looking for a bed for occasional use do not hesitate to purchase this product. It is well worth it!",2/5/2013

It was used for two small children over night and was wonderful.  Our second guest, and adult, spent the weekend, and found it extremely comfortable and high quality.  This past weekend, we took it with us to visit relatives, and we slept on it.  It lost air so quickly that every two hours we woke up folded into the middle.

After researching several options, I have been happy with this mattress.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*  easy to inflate.  Either plug it in and turn it on, or you can use and external inflation device if you don't have outlet power.  Of course, the internal inflation device in the mattress is much faster.  It will inflate in 2-3 min<br />*  Comfortable.  Of course this is still an air mattress, but it seems less &#34;bounce-housey&#34; than others I have slept on.<br />*  The deflate option sucks the air out to make it easier to fold and store.  This gets more air out than simply pulling a plug<br /><br />Cons:<br />*  Sheets are a bit difficult to fit.  There are several indentations in the mattress, that I suppose are for sheets, but the top one is too short, and the next one is a bit of a stretch.  A deep fitted sheet will fit, but if you move around a lot, it comes off easily.  The indents along the side of the mattress are not deep enough to really hold a sheet well.  This may not be a problem if you don't move a lot in your sleep.<br />*  Can be cold.  All air mattresses can be cold underneath if the room air is cold, but if you're counting on the softer top material to help with this, it won't.  It is much warmer if you use a mattress protector under the sheets<br /><br />We have yet to take it camping, as we have a different mattress we use for that, but I think this would be fine for that as long as you have a big tent.<br /><br />I'm happy with this purchase and would do it again",1/15/2013

Although this is a cheap bed, it is definitely much more stable than previous inflatable mattresses I have had.<br /><br />Cons:<br />•THE SMELL, it is terrible when you first inflate this item. It smells like some serious plastic. It smells like a toy for your pool. I wouldn't mind this too much and it is to be expected from a big blow up mattress, however, the smell continued throughout the first month.<br />•The bed is not level, it is more like a U shape. The middle of the bed sinks in so you will definitely roll in the middle if you have this bed fully inflated. I noticed however, that if you leave the bed a little softer, the dip is not be as noticeable.<br />•The seams in the bed just ripped today and now we have a big bubble on one side of the bed. The best way to describe this is imagine that this is the bed when we purchased it:  |nnnnnnn|<br />This is a view if you were sitting on the floor at the foot of the bed looking directly at the bed.<br />Imagine that in between each n is a seam running from the foot of the bed to the head of the bed vertically. You sleep on these little n's which have air in them. This is how our bed would look now after one of the seams has completely torn:<br /><br />|͡  nnnnn|<br /><br />So now, two of the &#34;bubbles&#34; of n's are connected to make one huge bubble that is virtually impossible to sleep on. It is a good thing that this is a very wide bed otherwise, I would trash it right now.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to use sparingly. Make sure to air this out outside or in your garage because the smell is extremely strong. I wouldn't recommend this for everyday use, although, it would be great for visitors and camping trips.<br /><br />You cannot beat the quality for this price!<br /><br />Hope my review helped!l, I would recommend this to use sparingly.

They slept comfortably with no problems.  Also my mom slept with them one night and the bed didn't deform or have popped up creases.<br /><br />The bed looks and feels great; specially for the price.  It's extremely easy to inflate, just plug it in to a power outlet and it'll inflate completely in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />The bed does deflate a little bit just like any other bed.  Air will escape through the microscopic holes in just about any material material so you can't help it.  No air bed is 'deflatable-proof', it's simple physics people.  At least it doesn't deflate during the night when you're sleeping, if it deflates just inflate it a bit and should last you through the night.<br /><br />The rated weight on this bed is 600 lbs, but I seriously doubt it would hold that much.  If anything 350 lbs should be your limit and even then you may want to deflate it just a little so it doesn't deform because of the air pressure.<br /><br />Also don't do anything stupid like jump on it, that's a good way to mess it up.  Yeah I don't need to tell you that, but you'd be surprised at the amount of dumb people out there.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very solid when inflated<br />-Faux-suede padding on top<br />-Nearly as high as a regular bed<br />-Perfect for guests<br />-Extremely easy to inflate and deflate<br />-Takes only minutes to completely inflate<br />-Comes with a carry bag<br />-Power cord included and has its little compartment inside the bed so you don't have the power cable sticking out<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not recommended for camping or outdoor trips as you need a power outlet to inflate it<br />-Not compact enough for road trips or traveling, the thing is a little big when deflated (a bit bigger than a computer tower) and a bit too heavy.

DO NOT POLLUTE YOUR HOME.<br /><br />Please do not buy this airbed if you love your health. First of all, let me tell you that I am a young scientist in my thirties and well qualified to comment on the material of this bed.<br /><br />I bought this bed for temporary use during relocation until my own bed and other stuff were delivered by the movers. I slept on this for 3 nights and it has already caused me enough damage that I had to go see a doctor this morning due to acute inflammation of my lungs. PVC material in this bed is so cheap that it releases highly toxic fumes (you can feel that strong new plastic smell). These toxic fumes can damage your respiratory system, cause hormonal imbalance as well as nervous and reproductive disorders. Just Google PVC fumes and you will find many articles describing it.<br /><br />Every morning when I woke up, my throat was burning and was full of thick mucus/phlegm. I had to clear out my throat and the mucus that I would expel was thick, dark yellowish/brownish. I didn't doubt the bed on the first morning but started suspecting it the second morning. Third morning, I was in a terrible shape and the moment I would enter the bedroom, my throat would start irritating and burning. Last night, I could feel my chest fully congested and I had an extremely painful night. I saw the doctor this morning and she has put me on 7 day rigorous treatment to clear out my lungs. Note that I am a non-smoker and am not exposed to any dust or other pollutants whatsoever.<br /><br />I packed this back in the box but the air inside my home still smells of the cheap plastic. These fumes can cause long term damage to young children. I am going to investigate this product more and do whatever is necessary to get this taken off the shelf. To begin with, I am reporting this to Consumer Safety.<br /><br />I BEG, please DO NOT BUY this cheap product. You will be thankful you read this review.",12/25/2012

Cons  - The tall mattress remains cold longer than a shorter mattress because there is more air to warm up.  - I spent a little more money to buy a thicker mattress pad to provide a layer between the sleeper and the mattress.  - The mattress has a 600 pound limit, so no sleeping with bears (oh darn).",12/3/2012

Packs up nicely, and the built-in pump is a major convenience (hopefully it lasts -- we've only used it about 5 times so far).<br /><br />Only minor issue is that a very small amount of air seems to leak out of this thing through after a full night's sleep (two people of average weight sleeping on it).  It's not a big deal, but I thought I should mention that.  Might just be mine, or perhaps a little leak in the pump valve or something.  Either way, works great!

Amazon does not cover this product after 30 days, and Intex offers absolutely NO warranty on their air mattresses.  This is because they know they have poor product construction.  Yes, this bed was incredibly comfortable (delaying my bed purchasing for 2 months!) but that Intex doesn't even offer a limited warranty against manufacturing defects speaks to how reliable they feel their products are.<br /><br />I'm not the only person that has had this issue - I wish I had clicked on other pictures before I bought this bed.  For what it's worth I had no other issues with the bed...it was comfortable and held air very well.  In the 2 months that my girlfriend and I slept on the air mattress we filled it up probably 4 times total.  It was more comfortable than the aerobed that I slept on, and I really wish it would have lasted us longer or that Intex would have replaced it.  I think it's a really poor customer service model to set - instead of having a negative experience I would have come back to Amazon and written how well Intex took care of me and replaced my bed without question.  Instead, they get a 1-star review and a long-winded review about how horrible the customer service is with this company.<br /><br />In the long run it's a few dollars saved at the cost of a horribly negative review.  If there are any other companies looking at this review the take-home lesson is that if you take care of your customers you develop a loyal base that will always speak well of your products.  Now, when one of my friends asks me about air beds I will have only one response \\""not Intex,\\"" rather than championing the company.<br /><br />I hope this gets read - I very rarely leave negative reviews, but I feel like this is something that needs to be addressed.",11/30/2012

I weigh 150 lbs. and have used it each night for most of that time. I am going to purchase its replacement soon and most likely will get this one again due to its low price and comfort level - I am VERY happy with this bed and am still able to sleep on it though it Pouffed tonight. It's a great height and made up- it looks and feels great for an ab. I have slept better and the numbness in my hip using an old conventional mattress has lessened over 90% in fact most nights I had no pain in hips at all. I will go over my options in the spring (or a bed blows lol) as to whether I will stick to an airbed, go all the way for a \\""real airbed\\"" or back to a conventional mattress but I must say- not having a problem with my hips when I sleep is a great relief and reason to stick with an ab despite potential for it's own unique drama. In adddition I like the coolness of the ab and think this is an asset 3 seasons out of 4. At this rate I would be going through 3 of these a year ($150.00 roughly) I also don't want to move a new bed when I'm ready to move (well within 3 years. SO? there are things to consider. Now I think an ab that is blown up and air let out repeatedly is taking more wear and tear? than one staying inflated and treated gently because there isn't an ongoing folding and unfolding creasing of the vinyl imo. ANY comments? suggestions?<br />I still recommend this ab over others under $100.00 all things considered; the Height for one- though I am a shortie this is taller than my old conventional bed and I PREFER this height. The lack of padded topper? I use a furry throw underneath me and rice bag for my feet- and keep an unfitted mattress pad on top on the ab. Another quilt may go under when it gets colder (25F out right now) but use a separate mattress topper, for me I choose not to pay that extra in each airbed purchased. Paying twice this price most likely wont gain you a much longer lasting ab from what I've read.(though some may have a 30 day or better warranty.

So my mother called Intex and explained the situation. She was told by Intex that there was nothing they would do. They won't refund us. They won't exchange it. They won't even repair it. Generally if a manufacturer only has a 30 day warranty on their items, that usually means the items are absolute crap and the manufacturer knows it. I will NEVER purchase anything from Intex again and am going to do everything I can to make sure other people don't either. At the very least, refund the money sincce your products usually aren't cheap. What a crock.",11/19/2012

I purchased this mattress several months ago to have as an extra bed. I live on the East Coast (Long Island) and after Hurricane Sandy hit, many people in my area and surrounding communities were displaced. I was lucky and was able to have my power and heat restored whereas many are still without.  That said, my home has been open to several unexpected overnight guests this past week. I was thrilled to be in a position to give people a warm place to sleep at night, and a place where they could charge their cell phone & other electronics. The overnight guest who slept on this mattress is a young boy. And every morning, he could be found sunken in the middle of this mattress. The leak is slow enough that your body isn't actually hitting the floor, but nevertheless, there is enough of a leak that in order for it to maintain it's firmness, you would have to refill it right before you go to sleep, and then mid-way through the night.  It's too late for me to get a full refund or replacement, but it would be nice if the company would reach out to me to replace it. I suspect my overnight guests will continue to remain in my home for several nights to come.... It would be nice if they didn't have to settle w/a half-assed mattress and just get a good night's rest when so much has already been lost....

However 3 months isn't very long at all. At $55 a bed every 3 or 4 months will cost you a little over $200 a year for a bed. I have had other airbeds before and they all suck but most of the other manufacturers will replace them no problem. With Intex you call them up on the phone but instead of them giving a exchange or maybe helping you trouble shoot the problem. The insist on you going back to the place you bought the item from. Sometimes this works sometimes it doesn't. If you bought the item at a local retail store you might have a chance to exchange it for another bed. If you buy it from Amazon.com there is no chance unless the damage is done within 30 days of purchase.

I only had to turn on the pump every 2-3 weeks for the first 6-9 months and then about once every week or two for the remaining time I used this as a regular bed.  During the last month or two of regular use, I did over-inflate once and that caused one of the seams to break inside of the air mattress.  This did not puncture a hole and the bed was still usable but the two middle \\""waves\\"" or \\""rows\\"" that you see in the picture on the top of the bed became one larger \\""wave/row\\"" in the middle.  So, basically, it was raised along the length in the middle.  It was uncomfortable to sleep on for me as I like to sprawl.  Fortunately, I just flipped the bed and the lump was not visible on the underside and I continued to use this for two more months until I decided it was time to purchase a real bed.<br /><br />Very happy with this mattress and I still use it when company comes.  So far, I've had one visitor who slept on it for an entire weekend and was surprised at how comfortable it was.  I would definitely purchase this again and will definitely purchase a second one if there's ever a time when I have more than a couple of guests needing a place to crash when visiting.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />One of the best purchases I've made.  I bought this because I was moving cross country and didn't want to take much with me.  I read a lot of reviews and decided to buy it and use it as a regular bed until I decided whether or not I wanted to make my move permanent.  For my first year here, I was renting a guest room with a bed in it so I opted to store this during my time there but now, I have my own place and I've been sleeping on this bed every night for a few months now, (Target organic cotton 300ct sheets fit like a charm!), and I'm very pleased at the quality compared to every airbed I've experienced prior to this one.  I do have to plug in the pump about once a week for a minute to maintain the firmness that I prefer, but it really doesn't lose that much air and it fills super fast.  Because I'm always cold, I have put a blanket and down comforter under the sheet for added warmth, and it has been working great thus far - not freezing like I was without the blanket.  Now that I've decided to stay, however, and I'm hoping to have some friends visit soon, I'm looking to buy a real bed and keep this one as a guest bed.  That written, I have to say this bed is far more comfortable than some of the \\""real beds\\"" I've slept on, especially after having lived in Europe for awhile. Again, I love how I can adjust the air to cater to the firmness/softness that I desire.  I would buy this again and I do plan on continuing to use this bed as my regular bed for the next month or two until I make that more permanent bed purchase. Totally worth the $$.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I've been using this as my regular bed for five months now.  I decided to hold off on the regular bed as this actually is working just fine.  I get a good night's rest every night and have no complaints.in the pump about once a week for a minute to maintain the firmness that I prefer, but it really doesn't lose that much air and it fills super fast.

It can get rock hard if that is your preference and deflates just as easily. According to the instructions, during the first use you will have to add air periodically due to the vinyl stretching and after a couple of hours and two air add-ins, it settled down nicely.  As an experienced back-packer and leisure camper, I know how to fold items up for maximum space saving but this thing is very hard to handle; its heavy...its awkward and I doubt if anyone could roll/fold it up into a sufficiently compact package for the included storage bag to accommodate, which is why I only gave it four stars...should note I have only used it once, so cannot vouch for its longevity.<br /><br />Update: To fold the thing into a size and shape that will fit in the storage bag: fold one third of the bed toward the opposite side, using the pump mechanism as a reference point for how far the edge of the fold goes, then fold the section that extends past the other side of the pump back on itself, repeat for the other side. Your goal is for the bed to be folded in such as way that it is no wider than the pump mechanism. Roll from the bottom, with the valve open to allow air to escape as you roll. If you roll it tight enough, it will fit in the bag.

Ok, I had read the reviews, so not necessarily a deal-breaker. (Neither was trying to refold to get it in the bag, it's easy if you look at it, and the intense plastic-y smell was obnoxious for the first few days). It held up fine for the first 2 nights. By the third use, it seemed soggy...but a brief top off with the pump worked. By the 2nd week, it needed frequent re-inflation. Now, it needs to be re-inflated almost hourly, plus, 2 of the seams (running lengthwise) have separated resulting in a body sized speed bump. We also just noticed a hole at the heat sealed seam on the side, it's location making effective patching impossible.<br />Perhaps we received a lemon, but the cons I've describe don't justify the seemingly cheaper price if I have to trash it after just a few months. The Wetzel Instabed (our nightly TV lounger, we'd paid about $100 or so or it) this product replaced was larger, higher profile, NEVER lost air and only really failed after kids repeatedly jumping on it caused a hole.<br />In summary, this is smaller, leaks and seems poorly made for the price.

Well, she had this old pull-out bed that killed my back after sleeping on it for a week (that bar that runs right down the middle!).  I decided that I wanted to get an inflatable airbed since I had a sleep-number bed at home that I loved.  Being a big guy (about 325 lbs), I knew that the inflatable airbeds usually didn't work out for me (they lost too mush air, sprang leaks, I would get in and still be able to feel the floor, etc), so I did a little searching.  I found the Intex Raised Airbed and decided to take a chance on it.  I had it shipped to my mother's house and next time I went down, I tried it.  It was wonderful!  The bed (unlike alot of the others) is so high off the ground, you couldn't feel the floor when you laid down on it.  You could adjust the softness by how much air you pumped into it (loved the Electric Pump) and it didn't lose air like alot of the other mattress!  It comes with a bag with handles that you can store it in (if you can't or don't want to put it back in the box).  I was so happy with this bed that I left the one I bought with my mother so I could sleep on it whenever I came to visit and when I got home, I bought another one for any guests that come to visit me to sleep on.

It has stood up to multiple toddlers bouncing on it, and has not had a problem with significant air loss because of the bouncing. Also, 3 adults and a bouncy toddler can be on the bed at the same time, just playing and reading stories, with no one being bounced off or any air loss :) Since it is set up 24/7 we do have some air loss, but only a little, I say i top it off once about every 3 weeks or so (only because she prefers the firmer side).

Cut to me having to pay $1400 on plumbing a week later and I found myself on the couch. So I got an air mattress, unable to afford a new bed.<br /><br />This bad boy worked nicely and it was comfortable enough. I loved the built in air pump and I hardly ever had to add air. One day about two months later I noticed one of chambers had split a seam all the way down the length of the bed and there was a bit of a bubble. No problem. Until a few weeks later when the chamber next to it also busted out, while I was chilling in the bed with my laptop. All of a sudden my right hip had slid down and I'm sitting next to what looks like body sized bubble. No joke, it looks like I was trying to hide a body.<br /><br />On the plus side its a convenient way to be propped up, I'm leaning against it right now. But at night it feels like I'm lying in a twin bed with my shoulders so scrunched together that I'm sore in the morning. And I don't so much as get out of it in the mornings, rather I roll out, like the bubble is pushing me out which is totally uncalled for, I don't snore that bad and damn it I was here first! I'm sorry to say that this thing has to go. If I'd wanted to sleep in such a small area and be shoved out of bed I'd get a twin bed and hook back up with my ex.<br /><br />Get the bed if you so wish, you might be luckier then myself, it appears to be a hit and miss.

I was looking for an alternative to moving a conventional bed across the country for a short time.  I decided on this air mattress after reading the favorable reviews.  The mattress was very easy to inflate and I was able to use a regular set of queen sheets as well as a queen mattress pad.  It was also very comfortable - my husband and I slept on it for one night.  My son added some extra air to it maybe twice in the first month - which was no big deal - the pump is very easy to use.  However, after about one month, an inner seam gave way, creating a large bulge.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told the problem probably occurred because of over-inflation. I was told to contact Amazon to handle the problem.  I had an excellent experience with Amazon's customer service, and was offered an exchange for a new mattress.  Thinking the problem was a fluke, I agreed to the same mattress.  The exchange process was very easy - kudos to Amazon for their customer service.  My son was very careful not to over-inflate the new mattress and was very careful getting on and off the bed.  However, after about six weeks, the same problem occurred.  I went back and more thoroughly read the reviews and found that this was a common problem with the mattress.  Needless to say, I will not be getting this mattress again.  Pros for the mattress are: ease of inflating and adding air, comfort, ability to use standard bedding, and the price.  The one con is obviously the seam splitting issue.  I think the bed would be good for occasional use - however I don't know how difficult it is to deflate the mattress and put it back in the case for storage.",4/21/2012

My first experience, was with a Mainstays raised airbed (manufactured by Intex as a low cost item for Wal-Mart).  It was smaller than advertised, and firmness was uneven after a few nights,  but it was mostly comfortable, and it held air.  I mean, like, I had that bed for more than two years, in three residences, slept on it every night, used it as a couch during the day at times, and for a few month stretch I even tried using it as a semi-inflated non-traditional box-spring for a real mattress.  And it held air.  I maybe added a tiny bit of air every few weeks on average.  It was more than two years before I woke up anywhere near the floor.<br /><br />The airbed is made by the same manufacturer, and had the same convenient pump, and I figured it would also hold air as long as my unit wasn't defective.  Reading the many positive reviews, I figured that Intex had probably worked out some kinks, in addition.  And it was raised 22\\"" off the floor, and it was cheap.  No brainer.  One thing I overlooked: people have been reviewing this airbed since 2006 I think, this was probably the older model.<br /><br />So anyways, I bought this airbed, this time around it was true to the advertised dimensions.  After a few days the firmness was notably uneven, but at least it was proportional.  The bed caved in slightly towards the middle and near the built in pump.  This is not ideal and seems to affect support, but can be remedied somewhat by properly shaped mattress toppers.  The bed also reeked of PVC, I know that should be expected, but you could smell it for weeks.<br /><br />With some cheap memory foam on the top half of the bed, this airbed felt ultra-comfortable, although for whatever reason I had trouble getting uninterrupted sleep, maybe a slow leak I wasn't paying attention to.  And less than two months after purchase (just outside the return range), I started waking up to a bed that was way too plush/waterbed-esque (and I likewaterbeds).  I couldn't find a leak, it was probably leaking from the valve.  While I was using this as an everyday bed against what it is supposedly made for: a.) I weigh around 150 and was only sleeping on this bed, b.) I had foam toppers covering the airbed to protect from punctures, c.) I had this airbed on top of a traditional mattress, raised from the floor so that nothing on the floor could have punctured it (and I could sleep on the mattress if it deflated).  Bottom line, it was a poorly made product.<br /><br />Amazon is selling this bed for $50 with free shipping (which for this product is probably worth at least $20).  They are either trying to get rid of their stock, or Intex has tried to increase production efficiency to profit from a popular airbed.  If you are looking for temporary use and luxury is not important, this might be a best value as it seems you risk a defective airbed from any manufacturer and non-defective units should work temporarily.  If you want something that will hold air, you might want to try the newer version of Intex's 13\\"" airbed which is manufactured for Wal-Mart.  If a well-made product is important to you, pay extra.  I bit the bullet and shelled out $120 for a new airbed this time around, but the firmness is even, it looks better, and has a one year warranty (I'll refrain from endorsing it until I've slept on it for more than a few weeks).",4/21/2012

They have proven to be convenient, comfortable and fairly reliable**. What I like particularly about it is its size, height off the ground and portability when it's time to move to a new apartment. My two chief concerns were leaking and comfort, none of which were of an issue; no leaks were sustained during ownership, and for someone who has slept on firm mattresses for most his life, it did not take much time to grow accustomed to the feel of the air mattress. Overall, I am fairly pleased with the product.<br /><br />**My only cons against this item is that there seems to be an issue with the internal stitching that help form the groove patterns. On my first air mattress, after about 9 months of rigorous daily use (for sleeping, studying on, and other activities), the stitching failed at one of the seams, causing a hump to form on the right side of my bed. The reduction of sleepable plan area became problematic for more than one person to sleep on the bed, so I decided to purchase another one, hoping that it would also last 9 months before hump-formation. After about 3 months of less rigorous use (only sleeping), the second air mattress also failed at the same seam, but with greater severity; this hump is about the size of a medium man. I suspect this is a manufacturing defect since it appears to be the same failure mode and at the same location.",4/2/2012

Their policy is to replace product only once ... then must reorder if still wanting the bed (which we did because it was a great bed initially before the baffling broke loose). Amazon gave us special consideration understanding that my wife can't go totally without a bed while waiting for the return process.

However, we were at a loss for a solution as we are both larger people (combined weight of 620 when we purchased the air mattress in October, 575 combined weight currently). We would always have problems with mattresses that were too low to the ground and resulted in back pain or air mattresses that would deflate due to our size.  This however has worked great. We have used about a dozen times since October, and it travels well. There is a slight latexy smell to it but honestly after about 30 mins you don't notice it much. We haven't had any deflating problems, but we usually realized after about 2-3 nights we just need to give it a short burst of air to make it firm again. We've slept on it for 6 nights straight at the longest and we are both pretty violent sleepers so I am amazed this has held up. I have terrible knees and having it so high off the ground it great, although getting up is a little difficult but that's moreso physics and weight than the product.  The pump is pretty loud, but it inflates decently quick. The biggest drawback is trying to keep sheets on this thing. There are ridges like a mattress but no actual gaps to hook a sheet in. I found buying Jersey Knit sheets work well because the velvety top liner on this thing grabs those sheets nicely. We have not tried it outdoors yet, but I do think it might be a little too high up to use camping unless you are in a very large tent with a full size doorway. If this mattress is still intact when we go camping this summer I will be sure to add on to this review.

It's also very comfortable and doesn't shimmy around while you are sleeping and moving on it. My parents use it when they visit and they like it because of the height. I have learned that older people have a more difficult time getting up and down from the floor or from a lower mattress, so they prefer this one. The one negative thing about the mattress is that it's difficult to keep a fitted sheet around it it. The side of the bed is a slippery plastic material, and even though it has an indentation where it appears you can grip the sheet, it tends to slide up and off. The best thing to do is get a large king size flat sheet and just drape it over the bed and try and tuck it between the mattress bottom and the floor. the top of the bed is a velour material so sheets won't slide on that area of the bed.

Within a week or two, the same thing happened to the bed my high school daughter (120 pounds) was using.  We bought the beds awaiting our furniture on a move to Alaska so we needed something that would last for at least 4-5 months while my wife closed up our house down south.  Unfortunately I guess we got what we paid for.  Next time I buy a more expensive one!",2/15/2012

In the case of bedding it is so that a person can buy King, Queen, Full or Twin sizes and expect them to all be a standard size. In my opinion this is not a Queen size mattress. It is much smaller than my Queen size Aerobed. Descriptions on the boxes were Aerobed: 78x60x18 and Intex: 80x60x22. I measured the Intex after inflation and it was actually 78x57x21. I deflated the Aerobed before taking any measurements but it was at least 3 inches longer and 6 inches wider than the Intex so it appears that it was larger than advertised but I believe it was closer to Queen size than the Intex. I'm not sure about the quality as I haven't used it long enough to make that judgement. If this lasts longer than my Aerobed (approx. 1 yr.), I'll try to remember to come back and reevaluate this review. Right now I'm disappointed in the size discrepancy.<br /><br />Follow-up<br />After about five months the bed developed a hump in the center that is several inches above the rest of the surface. You literally can't roll over the hump while you sleep. You have to stay to one side of the hump. About the same time it developed the hump it also started to leak a lot. The leak is so bad that you have to add air about ever two hours during the night. If I don't add air ever couple of hours I end up with a sore neck because of the position the deflated bed causes me to have to lay. It seems like the middle of the bed deflates faster than the ends or it could be that I just have a big middle which causes that part of the bed to sink down farther. I love the way an air mattress sleeps when everything goes well. I actually think it's the best surface I've ever slept on, but it appears I'm going to have to go back to a conventional mattress.",2/15/2012

I found it quite comfortable over the four months, and I certainly found it better than anything else I could have chosen for short-term sleeping needs (e.g., futons and so on).  It does get a little bit cold (as do all air mattresses)-- if you use it in a cool environment, I recommend putting an extra blanket under your sheet.  I did have to add a little air every few weeks, but with the pump, it was very easy.<br /><br />During the drive home, one of the internal supports broke, causing a bump that runs the length of one side of the mattress.  Some people find this uncomfortable, and some don't mind-- I think the moral here is to be careful how you pack it up when you're going to drive across several US states.  It deflates reasonably quickly (less than 15 minutes), but you do have fold it patiently and carefully if you want it to fit nicely back into its case.<br /><br />After having it for over a year, we still use it for guests regularly, and it retains air very well (compared to its original state).

The first night was unbelieveable! I slept so good I thought I was in heaven! What a wonderful bed!  That lasted all of maybe 4 weeks.  The first thing I noticed is that the seams in the bed separated causing a huge bulge in the left side of the bed. I deflated the bed, hoping this would solve the problem.  It did for about 2 days, then the bulge returned, this time it was bigger,as another seam had come apart. So I deflated the bed again and this time that didn't work and the bulge remained.  On Wednesday 02/01/12 I was awaken by what sounded like something streching and then a pop and I was flung across the room landing in front of my dresser. Which isn't that far from the bed but, far enough that I landed on the floor, hitting my night stand and everthing on it went to the floor and scraping my arm in the process. I immediately got up from the floor, plugged the bed into the wall deflated it, folded it up, went into my laundry room where I had kept the bag, (as I had discared the box it came in) placed it into the bag and went to my couch for the rest of the night.

The problem was, the (inevitable) leak that sprung on me happened exactly 31 days after  purchase, leaving me no other option than to try to get satisfaction from the seller. If you've read the reviews, you know that's not possible. I even came across an entire website devoted to chronicling the pathological resistance of the guy who answers the phone at CMS Worldwide Sales to even acknowledge a problem with the product. You can't reason, argue with, or fix crazy. So I ended up eating the $70.00 (prod + shpg.) Clearly I'm part of the 25% of customers who found this product defective. (If you do the math, to date there are 670 reviews that are 4 or 5-star, and fully 158 1-star reviews....One out of four people who buy this product get screwed.)  But here's my real question: Why, oh why, would Amazon allow a demonstrably defective, or at least functionally questionable product to continue to be sold on its website??? If customer satisfaction counts for anything, and I do believe it does at Amazon, why is there no probationary policy for vendors who receive significant numbers of bad reviews? This product should have been put on probation until it could demonstrate a track record of reliability.....Or maybe it's just me....dunno.

Works very well.  There are a few positives to see here.  Positives:  1. Built in pump.  Keep it plugged in through the night so that your guests can pump it (or deflate it with the easy to use turn valve) as they see fit throughout the night.  2. The height.  The mattress is about 3 feet off of the ground so guests will not feel like theyre sleeping on the ground (unlike some mattresses that are only 10-12\\"" off the ground).  3. The size of the bag.  We all know its such a pain to repack these things, but this one is rather simple.  The best part is the tote that it comes in has a large opening and is easy to pull over the mattress instead of the curled up sleeping back type that leaves you frustrated.  Neutrals:  1. The cord can be tough to pack back into the pump, but with a few tries it becomes easier.  I'm leaving this as a neutral since its definitely a positive that the cord can be packed into the mattress and concealed with a small plastic door, but a negative because its not the easiest to put in.  Truth is you can just leave the cord out and pack it into the tote!  Overall a great buy especially for the price (not to mention all of my guests think it was very expensive!!).",1/10/2012

It's nice that it is so high, it doesn't seem much lower than our queen at home.  I never had a sore back in the morning and slept well every night.  A night or two we pumped a little more air in, but it seemed to hold air well.  Taking it down and storing it wasn't actually that bad.  After we let the air out and rolled it up, it pretty much fit into the included bag and went in the closet with no sweat.

It didn't fold up as pretty as upon arrival, but it worked.  Our company used the bed for 5 days over the Thanksgiving holiday, and they said that it wasn't bad, and that it was the most comfortable air bed they've ever slept in (which is saying something as they travel to family a lot and feel that a cold, hard floor is more comfortable than ANY air bed any day!).  The bed steadily lost air during their stay, but as a flip of the switch refilled it quickly, it wasn't really a problem (although we do intend to find and patch the leak).

I thought that $55 (this product's price at the time I bought it) was a great price on an air-bed, and since I was in the market for one, I snatched it up. In my fervor, I broke the cardinal rule of Amazon shoppers: ALWAYS read the one-star reviews! I broke this rule, and I paid for it.  I give this air-bed one star, because a). It's a nice color, b). It inflates & deflates super easily, and c). It was, for the short time it worked, the most comfortable air-bed I've ever slept on.  Now for the bad parts: This bed is rated to sustain weights of 600 pounds. I'm no toothpick, but I like to think I weigh just a little less than a quarter ton, so when my air-bed's middle air chamber burst for no reason whatsoever, leaving a massive bulge in the center of the mattress (along with a lovely symphony of crackling sounds), I was a bit perplexed. After all, I'd had the bed for all of 20 days, and the most strenuous thing I'd put it through was sleeping on it. Silly me, thinking you can do that with an air-bed!   What's more, sleeping on this thing is like sleeping on top of a Jell-O mold. If you were a pirate in a past life, and, as a result, enjoy the gentle rocking of the sea, you might like this, but if you're not expecting it, be advised: Having the temerity to roll over at night will cause this air-bed to pitch and tilt and shift in abrupt and frightening ways. I guess it's a good thing it isn't very far off the floor!  Of course, there's no warranty. Honestly, I can't even be bothered to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon. I just consider this a lesson learned, and if you're wise, you'll save yourself the trouble, and learn from it, too.",12/3/2011

Just what I can expect from an airbed,"Following were my expectations when I started looking for an airbed.  1. It must be with good enough height so that I get a feel of alighting from a normal bed.  2. It must not require frequent refill of air  3. Must be portable, easy to fold, pack and put in a bag to carry.  This airbed simply fulfilled all my expectations.  One point to be noted was that during my first 3 days of use, I had to refill the air everyday. I will fill air(making it firm) before going to bed and by early morning 3am, it will start getting very soft, losing some air. Next day while going to bed, it would have lost more air such that I cannot sleep without re-filling it.  I initially thought there was something wrong with the bed and planned to return it back. However, I noticed that in the rotary knob present adjacent to the air filling switch on the bed, the knob needs to be turned 90 degrees clockwise for inflation and  90 degrees anti-clockwise for deflation. In my bed, I noticed that the knob was only 80 degrees clockwise. Once I rotated it further more clockwise so that it is exactly 90 degrees, then on, I have never had this problem of losing air frequently. Nowadays, I re-fill air only once in 2 weeks..Have recommended this bed to my room-mate and his bed works perfectly too..",11/25/2011

At the suggestion of a friend, I began using an old camping air mattress that had been laying around my parent's house  as a bed instead of buying an actual bed (SO much less work to move!). That lasted for a few months, but it developed bad leaks and wouldn't hold air for more than a few hours before going flat. I wanted to invest in something that was much better than the old one, and the Intex air mattress is fantastic! I've been using it as an ordinary bed for about 6 months now, and have had no problems whatsoever. It's tall enough to create the feel of a \\""real\\"" bed, and it feels just as good as a \\""real\\"" mattress! The built-in pump inflates the mattress completely in about 5 minutes, and with a flip of a switch it deflates just as fast. I only have to use the air pump once every several weeks to perk up the firmness (I weigh about 130 lbs., so there may be more wear if you subject it to more weight more frequently, but I don't know). I couldn't ask for a better air-mattress-and it's less than half the price of most other mattresses claiming to be \\""high end.\\"" Overall, great quality and great value.

Since I've used it, there has always been a VERY slow leak. I assumed it was just the vinyl expanding since it was new. I would wake up in the morning in a dent in the middle of the mattress. It was still holding air but no longer firm. This summer (3rd time in use), during the first night of inflation, the leak was worse. The next night wouldn't even hold air. The problem was in the pump. The air leaked around the edge of the unit as well as the center of the dial. I could turn the knob to open the vent to allow air to escape quickly but I could never close it down to completely shut off the air. I dissected the pump to see if I could clean it or make some repairs. There is a large rectangular gasket that seals the pump unit to the mattress. It was crimped during manufacturing which allowed a small amount of air to leak (hence the slow leak). The knob mechanism appears to require 2 smaller gaskets around the escape and inflation holes. They aren't there. Therefore the knob doesn't seal against the air holes. So where are the gaskets? They must have been there before, because the knob didn't leak initially. My guess is the way this is designed, there is a possibility that when the gaskets came loose, they could have easily been blown out of the escape hole during deflation. I wouldn't have noticed anything like that and might have swept it out with the dust. I've always used this mattress on a large piece of cardboard so it wouldn't come in contact with and small rocks or tiny sharp objects. The mattress seems to be sturdy with no punctures, but, the mechanics seem to be the big problem. I tried to contact Intex in Long Beach via email, but so far, dead silence.

I never deflated this bed and it has so far been inflated for about 50 days [I'm not in a hurry with the remodeling :) ]. Also I weigh about 160 pounds and the most weight this bed has seen on it was about 260 pounds total.    Initial impressions were worth a 4-star review. It wasn't too huge, held its shape nicely, was more comfortable to sleep on than the floor [which I did for about a month before getting this :) ],  also the built-in pump was nice and easy to use, BUT the bed did sink in the center making it a challenge for two people to sleep on it without rolling/sleeping on a slight angle (-1 star).    After some time I noticed that it did not stay in its fully-inflated form and got soft after a couple nights of use and I had to re-inflate it before going to bed to minimize the sagging in the center. This started to get annoying (-1 star) but still manageable.    After about 35 days of this (when Amazon's warranty expired...) I noticed something strange. The bed didn't fit in my room quite the same as it did when I first got it. IT WAS EXPANDING! I started wondering if the reason I had to keep inflating it was because its supports were not holding its shape, causing it to slowly expand. A few days later, the bed pretty much turned into an oval instead of a rectangle. The upper side-beam seems to have broken off (unglued?) between the outer and inner layers, causing the outer layer of the bed to bulge out like crazy. The bed now barely fits in my room, presses against 3 of my walls and almost prevents me from opening my door. It literally expanded by almost 2 feet in width and length. That's pretty crazy! (-1 star)    So here I thought that maybe I'll suffer with it for a bit longer, and this morning I find a hole in the top of the bed. Note, that this is not a puncture hole, it seems that the expanding of the bed has stretched the material so much that a hole formed near the end of one of the seams. (-1 star) And the hole-repair patch kit was not designed to fix holes in the top, on the Intex website there is a FAQ about this with this answer:    \\""Answer:  The repair patch is designed for vinyl surfaces only. However, fine sandpaper, or an emery board can be used to gently rub away the flocking. When that is complete, clean the area with nail polish removal solution so the repair patch will adhere to the bed.\\"" Nice.    I went on the Intex website to check for warranty info and here is what I found:    \\""Answer:  Intex airbeds do not have a warranty.

I am a firm believer of forming my own opinion about a product, but I should have listened to those who warned about this product. We purchased this bed so that it would suit us temporarily, not a long term option. This bed was comfortable the first few nights, after two weeks or so, it was losing alot of air. Soon after there was a hugh part that was inflated in the middle of the bed causing us to sink on each side. The seam came out so it looked like the bed was overinflated and it had a hump right down the middle of the bed. I couldn't return the bed because it was outside the 30 day return period. This a waste of money and it might work for some but not all. Purchase with caution!!!!!",6/15/2011

I bought this very same bed to replace a Coleman bed that i had for a while but just got tuckered out after 5 years. i was lured by the built in pump and the raised height but let me tell you-THIS BED IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!!!!! i blew it up and it has a permanent indent in the middle- if you put a small bouncy ball on it it would roll right to the center, that's how pronounce the indent is. Secondly, it lost air after the first night-i'm just sleeping on the bed-not jumping, not rolling around, i'm a pretty sound sleeper and i'm only 120lbs! When i went to blow the bed up the pump starts making a screeching noise and smelling like smoke so i quickly turned it off and ripped the plug out of the wall out of fear my air mattress would combust. Thankfully i had a manual pump from my previous air mattress that i could use since the pump was no forever broken, but had this been my first air mattress, i would have been screwed. That's not even all of it! The bed holds air for about 8 hours- i have to substantially inflate it every day because it gets saggy and i have checked it for holes with water by listening, even with a stethoscope and of course it doesn't have holes because i have babied this stupid thing! (i'm just trying to use it for a couple of weeks!). Next, i took off the sheets to wash them and after a week and the so-called \\""downy\\"" top (which is nothing but a sorry excuse for felt) has a huge wet spot in the middle of the bed.

It measures 60 by 80 inches in diameter and has plush, 20.8 gauge waterproof flocking which provides a peaceful nights rest. It even has a 600 pound weight capacity.  Very strong construction.    The Intex air mattress has dual chamber construction with the bottom chamber serving as an air boxspring and the top portion serving as the comfy air-mattress. An indentation on the side for bedding with fitted sheets helps make it easier to make the bed. The entire bed can be stored easily by flicking a switch, deflating and stowing it in the duffel bag that comes with the package.    Here are some of the best features:    - Airbed queen sized raised downy bed is comfortable and well made  - The bed retains its firmness during the night  - Comfortable waterproof flocked top  - Comes equipped with built-in electric pump  - Includes duffel bag with shoulder strap for easy storage  - Dual Chamber Construction  - Raised 22\\"" queen-sized air mattress",5/6/2011

I went through two cheap air mattresses (the cheapest I could find locally) which were not very comfy, and definitely were somewhat lacking in quality, given the fact that they each quickly developed slow leaks which eventually led to their being replaced, eventually by the Intex Raised Downy Queen Airbed.  I have to say, the first night I was super impressed by how comfy this bed was in comparison.  I can't say for certain just yet, but I may be holding off on buying a new \\""real\\"" bed longer than I had originally planned.  It's super tall, and the downy top really makes a huge difference as far as comfort is concerned.  With my blankets and pillows all arranged, no one would ever guess that underneath everything is an airbed that cost less than $70.  As I've only had the bed for about a week, I don't know how long it will last, but it's already withstood my 120lb Boxer jumping on it while my back was turned.  The last two airbeds each lasted less than two months of constant use, but the construction of this bed seems to be much superior, and I'm hoping it will last a bit longer.  Having the pump right on the bed is not my first choice, but I have to admit that being able to reach over in the middle of the night to release/add air to make the bed more comfy has been nice.  I was able to find the perfect firmness the first night, not something you can do with a normal mattress.  So far, I'm very pleased and have been sleeping beautifully!  UPDATE (11/8/11):  Just yesterday, after almost 7 months of continuous use (by both myself and my dog) my airbed died.  To be fair, I had a second large dog in the house at the time (babysitting for a neighbor) and the two dogs had to work pretty hard to put a hole in the thing.  A lesser airbed would have collapsed months ago with all the abuse its taken.  In the past months, this airbed has withstood children, dogs, pens, chopsticks (I sometimes eat Chinese food in bed), and never complained when I fell asleep with earrings in.  A very worthy airbed, which will be sorely missed.",4/23/2011

It needs to be thoroughly inflated to avoid the \\""hammock effect\\"" common to air mattresses, but once inflated it is comfortable.  The reason I took off one star is that it does leak a bit.  We only used it for about a week this first time, but every morning it was a bit down and we needed to add air for the next night.  The air pump works very well, so as long as it doesn't leak any more than this, it's doable.<br /><br />Another thing that's not so good is that fitted queen sheets will not stay on the bed.  Just one time of rolling over, even with conscious care, and the sheets are off the edge and up onto the bed.  Maybe if some clever user has figured out a fix for this they could post it here as a comment?  Please?  We used a regular mattress pad under the sheet and that seemed to help a bit, but the sheets still never stayed on overnight.  The sides are just too slick and slippery.  The manufacturer could have added some sort of ridge around the thing to grab the sheets, perhaps.<br /><br />Bottom line:  For an occasional bed, it is comfortable and if it doesn't leak any more than it does now, it is worth the money.<br /><br />Four Months Later Update:<br /><br />After not being at this house for three months we kind of expected to come back to a deflated bed.  NOT!  It was standing tall, seemed to have lost no air at all, and has been serving us well for another month now.

After realizing this, everything was perfect. We slept for 8 hours and didnt lose anymore air.  I am pleased with this bed and I would recommend it to friends.     Instructions say it holds 600lbs and since the combined weight of us is around 400 so I can say it is very sturdy. Since its raised 22 inches, the bed is very easy for my 6'1 husband to get in and out of.  The \\""flocked top\\"" is like a pressed velvet. Personally I wouldnt want to lay on it without a sheet, but it is soft. I was also worried that the bed would smell 'plastic-y' it did not. Pump cord isnt as long as expected but that wasn't a problem. It takes a bit of force to get the cord back in the storage comartment-it needs to be a little bigger! You need to roll the cord up small for it to fit well. One more thing:  The instructions tell you how to use a manual pump instead of the built in one, in case of electricity loss. Thats a big plus!     This bed is so comfy and looks JUST like it does in the pictures!",4/5/2011

My primary use is for visiting company, but also to bring along on road trips.  I have to say I'm impressed with this bed so far.  The built-in pump is very well designed with a long cord that my old aerobed lacked, which means I don't have to carry an extension cord.  The material the bed is made from feels thick and durable and is of a similar weight to the aerobed it is replacing.    I blew this up and slept on it the first night I got it, to ensure that there were no leaks and that it would be comfortable for my guests.  To my surprise, the bed was very comfortable - even when comparing to my memory foam mattress - and I woke feeling well rested.  The height is great for ease of getting into/out of bed, and the felted top provides grip to keep the sheets on, even if your guest is prone to tossing/turning.  I've since used the mattress on a road trip and it really does provide a comfortable night's rest.  I would recommend that you always put something under the air mattress when on hard floors - I use 2 old yoga mats - to prevent tiny, impossible to locate leaks from forming.    I can't speak to the longevity of this product as I have only had it a short while, but for less than half of a comparable aerobed...and what appears to be comparable quality, I am quite satisfied with my purchase.",3/21/2011

I know the first week or so we were putting in air and letting air out to find the most comfortable firmness. As well as trying to flatten out the rounded edges that seem to make you feel like you are rolling to the middle.  After adjusting the air and sleeping on the edges we are comfortable now. Maybe we are just used to it or it has evened out.    We have used this a everyday bed for 2 months and we just purchased the second one for our guest bed.  My MAIN suggestion is to put a memory foam pad (1 1/2 to 2 inches)on.  This helps not only with comfort but reduces any movement by anyone sleeping with you.  Also, if you don't use some kind of topper/pad it will be hard to use regular sheets (we use king sheets).  We put the fitted sheet around the pad and stuff the sheet and blankets between the pad and bed. Of course they sell sheets for this bed too.  A King size comforter looks the best because it covers the bed at the foot and most of the sides.    If your are looking for a airbed that is just like a bed this isn't it.

The bed inflated easily. My wife and I slept on it and our 2 small children ended up making their way on the bed during the night. We slept just fine. I should have added air the second night. It definitely lost some air and we were pretty uncomfortable the second night. I added air (which I said is really easy just plug it in and flip the button) for the third night and we slept pretty comfortably.

In the instruction manual it states that when folding the bed you should avoid tight folds because they create weak spots in the plastic, so we did a lazy fold and did not press down on the creases and was easily able to get it back into the carrying bag, other reviewers said the pump burned out after the first use. It states in the manual to not exceed 10 minutes of continual use. So we set a timer and started to fill the mattress and it was totally filled after about 6 minutes. same when deflating.<br /><br />The only thing we wish we had was a comforter to place on top of the fitted sheet. The bed was used on a hardwood floor and the cold of the floor filled the bed and made for an uncomfortable feeling. We had a thick blanket on top of us so we were in reverse- cold backs and warm tops. It made for a lot of turning so we could warm up our backsides. A foam topper or thick blanket on top of the mattress would eliminate the coldness.<br /><br />It was a bit moon-walkie but our experience with air-beds has always had this problem. This bed was way better than most. We had a coleman a few years ago that was quite comical in this area.<br />We got this for home use. We would never be able to use this in our tent. It's to tall. We have a 2 person dome style tent and the corners of this would be rubbing the tent.<br /><br />What sold me on this tent was the pump. The built in pump eliminates the most frustrating part of an air bed, the quick cap insertion after removing the pump. On all of our other air-beds no matter how quick we were we always lost enough air to make it a bit limp. We could never get that taut firm bed that we desired.<br /><br />No caps to install after inflating! I love it! Turn the knob to the right and inflate-done.

Well from August to October I used the Intex 2010 air bed; which was a piece of crap. I slept on it like a baby however after a month it sprung a few leaks. The Then I moved to the 2009 edition it I was skeptical. First its smaller than the 2010 edition. I was shocked at how small it looked in comparison at first. But that changed after about a month of use it stretched out a bit.   Construction: The bed sides are made of a hery heavy and durable plastic, that even withstood the scratching of my mini schnauzer. The top portion is made with a fabric material that is nice to the touch but isnt something you want to continously lay on without a sheet. The inside of the bed is a very complicated and intricate layout. its divided into three section levels, so that air is divided and maintained. Also those three levels are divded vertically by different sections , held together by plastic lining, that keep the sections separated. This design is basically so that youre not just sleeping on a bed with air in it. It works for those who use this bed to go to sleep at night but not for those who sleep at night and constantly lay on the bed during the day. Because if you keep sleeping on the bed for long periods of time the plastic lining will begin to separate/tear and youll be left with a oblong bed that will not be ok to sleep on.    I would recommend this air bed to all college students. Its cheap fast and will last half a year for nighttime sleeping.",1/4/2011

Pros:  -Inexpensive  -Comfortable (Disclaimer: I'm not super picky, and can sleep just about anywhere)  -Quick & Easy Inflation/Built-in pump  -Firmness is adjustable (by the level of inflation)    Cons:  -The seams began busting after a year (of continuous use). It is very loud when they 'pop' and will scare you awake.  -If you share the bed with a partner, the lighter person kinda slopes toward the heavier person.  -Needs to be re-inflated every few weeks (with continuous use).    Summary:  I recommend this bed if:  -You're using it in a guest room or as a backup bed  -You're using it as your primary bed, and expect it to last < 1 year    What do you expect for your money? Personally, I have no problem paying $50/year for a movable, temporary-esque bed.

It had a slow leak which caused a lot of leakage over an entire night.  The second unit isn't defective, but it's not a perfect bedding solution.<br /><br />Background:  My wife and I bought this mattress to comfortably provide a guest bed for her visiting parents who can't sleep in the bunk beds of the bedroom they'll be sleeping in.  The concept of this mattress is great -- an air mattress that sits high enough off the ground to make getting in and out of easier, especially for older adults.  Then, when your guests leave, deflate and stow away the mattress in a closet somewhere.  But my experience with this mattress isn't as good as it should have been.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our first mattress was defective because it leaked air badly throughout the night.  By morning, the mattress was very, very saggy.  My in-laws awoke in the middle of the night (while we waited for Amazon to ship us a replacement) just to fill-up their air mattress so it was reasonably firm.<br /><br />Our replacement mattress doesn't leak at all like the first mattress.  However, the mattress tends to sag in the middle -- it doesn't provide a perfectly level sleeping area, which is somewhat disappointing.  The upside is that my in-laws are sleeping well on this second, replacement mattress.<br /><br />What I LIKE:<br /><br />- The built-in pump easily inflates and deflates the mattress.  No misplacing the pump or forgetting to take a pump with you if you're using this mattress for camping!<br />- Very affordable<br />- My in-laws are sleeping well on it<br />- Can easily be stowed in a closet in the travel bag that came with it<br />- Sits high enough off the ground to make it easy to get into and out of.  It's much nicer than the camping air mattresses I'm used to, which sit just a few inches off the ground.<br /><br />What I Do **NOT** Like:<br /><br />- The manufacturing process apparently doesn't leak-test their products before shipping them out the door.  The quality appears to be quite spotty.<br />- When lying on the mattress, you sense you're being drawn into the middle of the mattress.<br /><br />Conclusion:  This seems to be a hit-or-miss product.  For some, their air mattress doesn't leak air and is firm and comfortable.  For others, their mattress leaks air or springs a leak too quickly following the sale.  If your expectations aren't too great, this might be a good value.e shipping them out the door.

We bought two Intex Airbeds for our grown sons' occasional visits. Six months later, son #1 moved back home and began sleeping on his airbed full-time. For the next 3 months, no problem but then, quite suddenly, that bed started losing air pressure. We searched and searched for a hole that could be patched but could find nothing, so he switched to the second bed. Within a month, two of the upper chambers in the second bed gave out and it began to balloon in the middle - right where he sleeps.    Perhaps I was naive to think that an airbed could be used \\""full time,\\"" but I hadn't read anything to warn me not to think this way so, shame on me, or shame on them?

I like the extra heighth you get with this matress, with a matress pad, sheets and comforter, it has the appearance of a normal size bed. The bed is very comfortable and i sleep very well on it.  It does not have the stability of the twin airbed so you get this somewhat 'wobbily' feeling when you get in and out of bed, kind of like the early waterbeds.  Also, the twin bed's construction was thicker and more durable all the way around as opposed to just the top layer of the raised queen bed..plus of course it is bigger which could also make a difference.  Finally, i have a small leak somewhere which requires me to air it up a little every two to three weeks.. the built-in pump makes it a breeze to do but it is a little annoying..by the time i realized i had a leak, it just didn't seem worth the trouble to pack the thing back up and everything that goes with it...it does come with a patch kit...so i took soap water and went over the sides and bottom but could find no visible leak so i suspect it's in a seam somewhere.  That's pretty much my input on this product. If i had it to do over again, i probably would give up the heighth for the better stability of the ozark trail.

I read the reviews on Amazon.com before my purchase and I leaned towards this item.  The description is accurate other than the surface size seems a tab bit smaller than a queen.  Perhaps not, but it seems to be in between a double and a queen.  The package arrived as promised (according to my shipping selection) and all items were in tact and operational.  The bed unfolded easily and also inflaed easily and quickly.  I agree with other reviews that it is very convenient that the pump is self contained (one less thing to mess with upon set up).  The bed seemed to hold its air.  My first guest said that it was too firm.  (I really pumped it up though). My 4 year old now sleeps on it and he prefers it over his other bed (a queen mattress). The height is also accurate.  The fact that the bed is really raised makes it easy to get in and out of and upon first glance into our guest room, it appears to be a regular bed.  We leave it set up now continuously.  When we broke it down the first time, it was a little hard to fold back into the bag, but then again, isn't it always difficult to return an item to its original shipping/packaging?  We were still able to put it back into the travel bag.  Also, it holds our queen size sheets beatifully, they did not slip off. Looking back, I would purchase this exact same model and size again.

While I can't opine on the longevity of this mattress yet I can give you my opinion a few of the more immediate pros & cons of it.     We just returned from a 4 night camping trip, using this mattress. We were looking for a new air mattress for our trip because I am 8 1/2 months pregnant & there was NO way I was going to be able to get up off a regular air mattress. I bought this BECAUSE of it's depth. Set up was so quick & easy - plug an extension cord into the built in air pump (SUCH a handy feature!) and turn it on. I pumped it up initially. I under-filled it, thinking with 2 of us on it that it would be ok. We slept on it that night & while it was great for my hips & belly (I sunk into the mattress & it was comfy!) my husband & I had to sleep on opposite sides of the bed or else we'd roll into each other. Since cuddling wasn't an option we added more air the next day. PERFECT. Slept on it 2 more nights, then had to add a little more air for the 4th night. I don't think it was leaking air through a hole, it was just the pressure of an average sized man & 8 1/2 month pregnant woman sleeping on it! The height of it was perfect for me to be able to get up off it without needing a hand. When we were breaking camp, deflating it was just as quick & easy - plug in the pump, turn the dial to deflate & turn it on. It was totally deflated (and looked vacuum packed!) within 3 minutes, tops. Roll it up & put it into the included carry bag. That is my ONLY con for this mattress - the bag doesn't look sturdy enough to protect the mattress from potential rips & tears while packed away. You could re-pack the mattress/bag into the box for more protection. We didn't & decided to store it away from the rest of the camping supplies instead to avoid punctures. Again - buy this mattress, you will not be disappointed!",8/8/2010

This bed *might* be ok if you're sleeping in it alone and you can take up the whole bed, but if you're sleeping with a partner it sucks.

Unfortunately, I ordered it too late for the trip, so I purchased a coleman the night we drove down. I was okay with the coleman until I got home and inflated this mattress. Now, it is an air mattress, so by no means is it a replacement for an actual mattress, nor do I expect it to last for years and years, but as far as air mattresses go, I think this will do the trick!    I do not remember reading the product discription here on amazon including the information about this mattress having built in air chambers, but on the box it came in, it does state that. It makes for a very comfortable mattress. It also seems to sleep two people more comfortably than the coleman for whatever reason.    I noticed right away, compared to the flocked top of the coleman, the flocking on this mattress was far softer, and the fibers longer, denser, and generally more cloth-like. Much softer to the touch than the coleman.    The intex also holds it's shape much better. It feels more stable when laying on it, and more mattress-like than the coleman (ie-more supportive). I feel that this is probably due to the air chambers in the intex. To me, the coleman feels like a squared out air balloon. It results in alot of motion transfer when shifting positions that I definately did not notice this with the intex. It also makes for a less comfortable rest. I feel like I am wrestling the mattress sometimes. Another big difference was the air pump. The coleman has a great pump that is not integrated into the mattress that I was very pleased with. It was very useful for inflating multiple objects, not just the mattress. It is a very strong little pump! The intex has an integrated pump, and I am still not sure if that is better or worse. It worked well, though it did take longer to inflate than the coleman. The little hide away chamber for the power cord is a thoughtful addition that I do like, however, be aware that the cover is not attached to the unit, and I have already misplaced mine. One thing I think would have been an improvement to the pump is a little power assistance in deflation. I let it deflate it's self, and it took a very long time to completely deflate. I am hesitant to force the air out due to the inherent delicate nature of an air mattress.    As far as holding air, I did not spend an entire night on this mattress, so I do not know how well it holds air through the night, but for the several hours I spent on it, it held just the right firmness. The coleman had to be \\""topped off\\"" a couple of times durring the two days I was out at my family's lake house, but that could also be due to the temperature shifts from day to night, and not a big issue. Having to add a little air after a day or two is to be expected. The air mattress is not 100% impermiable, so I would suspect that the intex would have the same needs.    I gave this product four stars out of five because of the air pump. I feel that the air pump could use some improvement, but overall, it is a good buy, and it was cheaper than the coleman. The price for this intex is really great for the product you get.",7/8/2010

We have spare bedrooms, but do not own guest bedroom furniture.  The thought of dropping a few hundred on something we would feel comfortable letting our friends sleep on was daunting, so we turned to air mattresses instead.  I browsed products and reviews for a few days but kept coming back to this Intex model.  It was definitely the highest reviewed among the products I looked at, and for the size, the most attractive in price.  Coupled with Amazon's free shipping, this seemed too good to be true, but within a couple of days of ordering I was plugging it in and giving it a test nap.<br />From the moment I opened the package to the moment it was ready for testing, a full six minutes elapsed.  Only slightly less than four of those were the actual inflation process.  I am highly impressed at the speed it goes from completely flat, to completely full.  It has a pleasant firmness, and although it lost some pressure during the first overnight test, I woke up without a kink in my back as I usually do on a typical camping air mattress.  The height is perfect, and the grooves along the side make fitting it with sheets just like a regular mattress.<br />I am also impressed with how quickly it can be deflated.  The built-in pump has a directional setting that allows you to reverse the flow and actually pump air out.  This allows you to fully deflate the mattress in about as much time as it takes to set it up.<br />Some reviewers mentioned using it as their full-time mattress.  I don't know that I would make that switch, but I do know that for an immediate solution to the problem of providing for guests, this is perfect.

They are two average size adults and have slept comfortably on it for almost two weeks. They had to inflate it a little every other night, but it is very easy to do due to a convenient build-in pump. It has been inflated since they left and its been over a month now, and the bed holds air well. Of course it needs a little inflation if someone wants to sleep on it, but I think this is inevitable with any airbed.   The bed is pretty comfortable and the size is very close to queen.

When i was reviewing reviews on this product prior to my purchase, i noticed many people were concern about being cold at night due to the air in the mattress.

Several of the reviews state that this bed is actually full size, and while that was true when I first inflated it, after two months of sleeping on it this bed had definitely stretched out to queen size. In fact, the new queen sheets I bought just busted at the seams putting them on. If using this bed full time, I recommend letting sheets stretch naturally with the bed, that could help (or deflating some before putting them on, then reinflating). I actually wish this bed were full size as that is what I expected from the reviews and my room is quite small.    Size aside, this bed does not seem to be losing air after 3 months of use, and is quite comfortable. The lengthwise humps/ridges/tubes or whatever you call them are pretty noticeable though, and I am looking into to some sort of rigid mat I can place between the mattress and the memory foam topper I have to minimize that effect.    Overall: very good for an air mattress, and at ~$60 quite a good price as well.    UPDATE: After 8 months some internal seams appear to have torn, causing one side of the bed to become a huge hump. It is no longer usable. I kept this bed really inflated to make it nice and firm, and perhaps that affected it. If it had lasted at least a year I would have said it was worth the money, but as it is, meh.",10/24/2009

I find myself going to bed a hour earlier, just to be near this beloved bed. All visitors are made to go upstairs, lie down, and experience the wonder of my Downy Queen.     The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it sags a bit in the middle (I only weigh 125 pounds)...perhaps because I don't like sleeping on the side near the wall. No other reviewers mention the sagging, so maybe I need to find someone to sleep on the other side. Trust me this bed could help anyone snag a man!    Addendum:    After 6 months of daily use my beloved bed \\""sprung a bulge\\"". Apparently one of the walls between the vertical cells leaked causing the outer cell to bulge up 3 1/2-4 inches. a couple of months later the outer cell on the other side of the bed did the same, so i was sleeping in a near-tunnel.    Finally, as a last ditch solution, I flipped it over and put some padding on the floor under the 'cavity' created by the bulging sides and viola: it's like having a new bed.    also (i hate jinx myself) but i had some workman in the house when i was away and somehow the bed got punctured and i came home to a totally deflated bed. I'm happy to say i used the patching kit included with the bed, and surprisingly it has held up for 2 months.    in spite of these problems, i'd still say this is an incredibly comfortable bed, and while it probably shouldn't be purchased for a primary bed, I think it's a great choice for a guest bed.",9/23/2009

So far, guests have not used it but we have at a friend's house a few times and absolutely love it.  Everyone that sees it comments on how big and comfortable it is for being a blow up mattress.  I usually put a blanket or two under the sheet to take away the ripple feel because it's not a completely flat surface.  It truly does take a few minutes to blow up (it's so nice not having to get find the pump to blow it up since it is built in) and slight deflation over night doesn't happen for us.    Two complaints:   When you get toward the end of deflation, the pump sucks in the mattress material and starts to cut off airflow almost completely.  I have to turn it off and move the material away from the flow a few times before all the air gets sucked out and is small enough to put back in the bag.  This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't transporting it.  The strap of the bag ripped out after bringing it back and forth to another place 2 times, I had to find a duffel bag to put it in now.

4670,US,47375897,R31KAW003A76R2,B000M0MJU2,805416447,"Intex Raised Downy Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump, Queen, Bed Height 22""",Outdoors,3,21,25,N,N,Not As Good As I'd Hoped For...,"It's been a month or two since I purchased this replacement mattress and I'm still sleeping on it. My back actually prefers sleeping (daily) on air mattresses, as opposed to sleeping on regular coil/box spring/mattress stuff because there really are no 'hard and pokey' kind of spots on these mattresses. I purchased this product as a replacement for a previous Intex raised air mattress, (that I had for 3-6 months), which blew out an internal air chamber or 'baffle'. While this bed did not 'deflate' at all, thereafter it was lop-sided, essentially becoming a twin bed instead of a queen. However, there are differences between this (apparently) newer Intex mattress and that first Intex. It appears to be in how it's internal air baffles are constructed. In this newest version, with the 'dimpled' top, I found that after using it during this period, the mattress tends to 'sag' in it's middle. Not a horrible problem yet, but noticeable. In the older Intex mattress, the internal air baffles appear to run end-to-end in it's construction and it's top was not 'dimpled' but took on a 'side-by-side, 'log-looking' effect. When that mattress was inflated, I never noticed the sagging in the middle that I notice with this bed. I purchased this latest Intex because it was reported to be about 3\\"" higher in sitting off of the floor, (a feature highly desirable to me as it's much easier for an older person, like myself, to get in-and-out of). Both Intex mattresses needed to have a sort-of \\""maintenance inflation\\"" done every 2-3 days to sleep on them comfortably with minimal sagging. (Here I'm talking about under inflation, not sagging due to internal construction). But with the built-in pump, an absolutely wonderful feature, it takes takes only a few seconds to inflate it as desired by flipping the power switch on the pump. (i.e, I keep it plugged into power constantly). So this was not a big deal or any kind of a deal-breaker for me. All-in-all, I liked the end-to-end baffles better forsleeping on just because they don't seem to sag as much, but I'm learning to live with the newer type of baffles because I like the added height of the bed. I see the 'dimpled' mattress tops on other air mattresses, and in-fact, I purchased a GreatLand mattress with a such a top from Target. (This purchase was sandwiched in-between these two Intex mattresses). I subsequently returned it because it's top was harder, it sagged excessively in the middle, and the air pump was separate from the bed. Thus, in my opinion, these 'dimpled' top style air mattresses seem less desirable to me because, apparently, 'sagging' appears to be a common theme among them. I might add, that before any of these past three air mattresses I've owned, I had one of those high-end style, self-inflating, Select Comfort mattresses. Technically, it was a king-sized bed, but it lost a great deal of it's surface area due to the 6-9\\"" foam 'edging' surrounding the internal air mattresses. Ultimately, I deemed it as not worth the thousands of extra dollars in cost just to have the self-inflating, automatic air pump, and I sold it. To me, its sleeping comfort was no better than these less expensive air mattresses. (Would it have lasted longer than these other air mattresses, undoubtedly, and well it should have because of its high cost). However, I don't think it slept any better. I hope people find this review helpful...",5/29/2009

Having a leaky air mattress deflate on a guest would be a nightmare for me.  Having all ages of guests it is important that the mattresses be double high or 22\\"" or about.  Who wants to be inches off the floor?  My requirements are; comfort, durability, ease of inflating and deflating, ease for user to control firmness and support, and storage.   I have tried all of the air mattresses on the market, from inexpensive to high dollar, with and without built in pumps, low to high profiles.  Before double high mattresses where on the market I would stack two mattresses on top of each other, well it was comfortable it had a tendency to walk off each other.  Mattresses without built-in pumps would somehow need the adaptor that wasn't put back in my pump bag.  If the pump was exposed my over zealous tenants would inevitably take it off to deflate the mattress and parts would often get lost or broken.  I have enough different brands of mattresses that I can stack to the ceiling.      When I discovered Intex air mattresses my fears were put to rest.  They have proven to be the most comfortable, inexpensive solution that outlasts the competition in durability and reliability.  I have 10 twins and 2 Queens and every one of them is leak free and they are about 2 years old and I feel they are still reliable.  They hold up to the ware and tare of extended use and various users.  The pumps are encased so they can't be taken out or leak air, many external pumps I found would be the source for slow air leaks.   I can inflate/deflate, and fold them easily to go back in their supplied tote bag.  Many of my guests have been so impressed with their comfort, comparing them to a sleep number mattress; they have asked were they could buy one.  The twins are large enough to accommodate tall and heavy guests, much to their surprise.  I have one twin that has been inflated for over a year, with an occasional inflation maybe once a month.  Our two labs and cat have claimed it for their own personal use, and guess what it has held up remarkably.  We have taken it camping, all you need is a converter gadget that will allow you to plug into a 12v and you can use your car lighter to inflate it.

We bought it because our other air mattress was useless- we could never make it through the night without winding up sleeping directly on the hard floor;  pretty typical of air mattresses.  This is totally different.  It's firm, comfortable, inflates and deflates fast with the built-in pump and it stays inflated all night!  Best of all, if you need to adjust the firmness at any point you can add more air/let some out right from the bed!  It's an incredible deal, well worth the money and I highly recommend this product.",4/8/2008
